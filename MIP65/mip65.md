## Sentence Summary

Arrange, coordinate and execute a liquid bond strategy to replace part of the current Maker USDC exposure.

## Paragraph Summary

The MIP intends to accomplish the following over a short time frame

* Set up a starting Liquid Bond Strategy to replace part of the Maker USDC funds
* Select professional fund manager for execution of above strategy
* Setup Maker Execution and Governance operating platform necessary for implementation
* Implement and Deploy USDC [TBD]M
* Devise staged plan for further deployment

#### *The progression through the above phases will be done with full community transparency, discussion and approvals.*

## Component Summary

[TBD]

## Motivation

* USDC is a large single-asset exposure on Makers’ balance sheet - and pays no yield.

* We believe, working with professional bond managers, a starting diversification strategy should, and can, be implemented ASAP. Remaining appropriately liquid and secure, but with non-correlated risk exposure and yield generating

* From the many discussions and proposals on the Maker forum on this topic, we believe there is solid consensus in the Maker Community on the necessity and desirability of this course of action. What is now needed is someone to do the work to put it in detail and practice.

* Arranging, coordinating and executing the above, in our view, lies within the purview of the intended Arranger role - and in this case, within our particular skill-set - and so we intend to act as the community’s “tip of the spear” turning the above thoughts into fact - quickly and efficiently.

* A secondary motivation is also to further clarify the Arranger role in practice.

## Specification / Proposal Details of Project Clydesdale

### Monetalis Role

Before delving into the detail of the proposal, I think we need to clarify Monetalis role, so nobody gets the wrong idea:

* We will act as a facilitator/coordinator/project manager, and generally be the practical hands in ensuring a clear, paced progress of the community sentiments and choices into a practical executed solution.
* We are **NOT** setting the bond strategy, choosing the fund manager or the execution/governance platform - we will provide practical options to the community to review and choose from and push it all towards an appropriate MKR vote.
* We will, of course, coordinate with all relevant CUs during the process

Basically, we bridge the off-chain “Execution Gap” that, at least for now, sits between CUs analytical, review and recommendation powers - and the Community/MKR Voting/decision making powers.

### The Solution for Execution

*for continued update -*  **Version 0.0  /  6/2/2022**

This section will be filled out as the process progresses and the various pieces of the solution appear and community consensus around them is achieved.

Here is a strawman solution - purely for example and reference:

|Dimension|Choice|Documentation & Reviews|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Deployment Amount|USD [TBD]|-|
|Fund Manager|X&X AM|-|
|Fund Strategy|-|-|
|Fund Agreement|-|-|
|Execution Platform|-|-|
|Execution Platform Agreements|-|-|
|Third-party Agreements|-|-|

### The Train Schedule

We have designed the process in overview as follows:

https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP65/supporting_materials/train-schedule.png)

The detailed plan can be found in this spreadsheet: [ProjectClydesdalev1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yvwQ_NrJ5SiQmYHCw-9lMH7BQSoy4ZpeWaI4RIBg-Yc/edit?usp=sharing)

### Reporting & Transparency

This will be a transparent process and so we will report on both the project progress and the solution building on this website: https://clydesdale.brick.do for easy access. Of course all relevant discussion subjects and reviews etc will also be posted on the forum under this MIP.

### “Train on time” ?

We would love to give the community tight timelines and a promise to get the train running on time. Unfortunately, as with all complex transactions, there are a multitude of third-parties involved in the process, who are out of our control.

We will certainly drive the process towards the above train schedule, and we will make it very clear in the transparent project progress monitoring who/what is holding back the schedule and for how long. We believe this is the best way to encourage getting the train on time in this particular execution environment.

### Why Monetalis?

We have the skills. Designing, driving and executing complex, multi-party transactions is the day-to-day job of any private equity executive.

We have designed the asset side of balance sheets for insurers in several countries, which were mainly bond-strategies - and worked with external fund managers to co-design and execute these.

We are now, after the MIP21 process with Monetalis SME wholesale lending platform, also quite confident about what are issues around Maker off-chain execution platforms and how to solve them in a comfortable way.

We know the CUs who can/should provide insights to the community through the process.

Lastly, we hope we have shown the right long-term Maker ecosystem partner attitudes: being transparent and open, presenting thought-out solutions and ideas, trying to add value in community discussions, and seeking consensus and compromise solutions.

### Budget/Compensation

We have decided, as we are here breaking new ground, to go into this process and deploy resources without any specific agreement on compensation or budget. We are confident a fair solution can be found and agreed over the course of the project.
