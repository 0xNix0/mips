## Paragraph Summary
This subproposal onboards Prototech Labs LLC as a Facilitator for the Protocol Engineering (PECU-001) Core Unit, represented in the community by @Derek.

## Specification

### Motivation
The motivation for this change is to formalise the inclusion of a legal entity into existing facilitation activities. All current Protocol Engineering activities will continue as per the team mandate.

This formality also helps to move the team forward in terms of branding and alignment with the Endgame as PECU prepares for new scope discussions. 

If the [MIP4c2-SP34](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip4c2-sp34-expand-facilitator-definition-to-allow-entities/19736) in RFC passes on which this MIP is based, and if this MIP passes, the facilitation of the PECU-Core-Unit will be handed over to Prototech Labs LLC represented by @Derek. If MIP4c2-SP34 does not pass, there will be an open position for PECU facilitation after a 3 month handover period.
