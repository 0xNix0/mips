## Sentence Summary

This subproposal onboards @Patrick_J as a Facilitator for the GovAlpha (GOV-001) Core Unit.

## Specification

### Motivation

I am applying to become a Facilitator of GovAlpha as the next step in my relationship with MakerDAO. I have been a GovAlpha contributor since June 2021 and have found working with the team to be a pleasurable experience.

I feel fortunate that what started as a general interest in cryptocurrency sparked by buying my first Bitcoin in 2013, before discovering Ethereum in 2016 and making my first foray into MKR in 2019, has now developed into a full-time position with GovAlpha contributing, in my small way, to what I regard to be the foremost cryptocurrency project.

The coming months and years are positioned to be very promising for MakerDAO as we continue to grow and cement our position in the ecosystem. The governance of the DAO is crucial in ensuring that DAI users, Vault owners, Core Unit contributors and MKR holders are able to collaborate and grow the Protocol together. GovAlpha's role in this is essential and I am excited to help the DAO in whatever way I can.

I was honoured when Payton and Long approached me about becoming a Governance Facilitator. I hope that I will be able to live up to the examples they have set and help MakerDAO continue to grow into the future. In addition, they have been kind enough to give me a leadership role within the Core Unit. I view becoming a Facilitator as the next step in formalising this role within the team and allowing me to take on more responsibilities within the DAO.

GovAlpha has many responsibilities within the DAO, but I believe that responsibility for the voting system and the executive vote implementation process are critical parts of the DAO structure. A high degree of competence and professionalism are required to carry out these responsibilities. I believe that I have demonstrated the attributes necessary to perform this role.

### Facilitator Commitment

I commit that as a Facilitator, I will adhere to the principles laid out in the [GovAlpha mandate](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip39c2-sp3-governance-core-unit-gov-001/6348).

These principles of neutrality, facilitation, effectiveness and communication are crucial for us to function within the DAO and ensure its effective operation.

I will be open to criticism and comments from within and without the Core Unit regarding my and the team's performance and suggestions for how things could be improved.

If ratified, I will uphold the high standards that Long and Payton have set as Governance Facilitators.

I have an interest in continuing to enable growth within the team by allowing contributors to pursue projects and roles that interest them.

Other commitments to the community include:

* Ensuring the smooth operation of the polling and Executive Vote process.
* Being available to answer questions on governance-related matters.
* Close monitoring of the GovAlpha budget, returning the unused excess budget to the protocol every quarter and ensuring that we provide a good value service to the DAO.
* Chairing/hosting DAO calls and meetings.
* Communicating CU work and achievements.
* Interfacing between the CU and the community.
* Assuming responsibility, along with the other Facilitators, for the performance of the Core Unit.
