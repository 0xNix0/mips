## Sentence Summary

MIP41c4-SP39 onboards @christiancdpetersen to serve as Core Unit facilitator for RWF-0x.

## Paragraph Summary

Due to his professional experience, demonstrable history of structuring and executing RWA deals for MakerDAO, unique ability to navigate the regulatory landscape ahead for RWAs, and credible neutrality, Christian Petersen is well-suited to facilitate RWF-0x.

He has 25 years of international business development, cross-border transaction structuring and legal execution experience to support the onboarding of high-quality real-world assets to Maker. He has further led international commercial transactions of all types while at international law firms in Washington, DC, Hong Kong and Tokyo (15 years), in-house (10 years) and with the Maker Real-World Finance Core Unit (RWF-001) since March 2021.

As a contributor to the RWF-001 Core Unit and as the proposed Core Unit Facilitator of the incubating Legal & Transactional Services Core Unit (“LTS”), he has unambiguously demonstrated his value add to the Maker real-world asset program. Despite industry obsession with a separate risk (legal, portfolio, commercial etc.) function, legal and risk are inextricably linked to underwriting. As such, it is not necessary or useful to have a separate legal core unit to support RWAs.

## Specification

### Motivation

As a Core Unit Facilitator, @christiancdpetersen can more proactively help the Maker DAO token holders devise and implement a real-world asset strategy for MakerDAO, whether such strategy is in the form of arrangers, MetaDAOs or otherwise.

He has spent his entire professional career structuring cross-border transactions and fully understands “best practice” for the implementation of real-world transactions. He also knows, from having implemented transactions across more than 45 countries, what can be modified to address Maker’s constraints and objectives.

In his work to date for Maker, he has amply demonstrated to the Maker community, other Core Units, and potential Maker customers that substantive experience, open and transparent communication, and a willingness to collaborate are the essential ingredients for a successful implementation of a real-world asset strategy.

### Facilitator Commitment (From @christiancdpetersen)

As Core Unit Facilitator, my commitment is to:

- Be directly accountable to the Maker token holders for performance of RWF-0x. I want to provide the Maker token holders with information and experience-based guidance as they continue to evaluate real-world assets.
- Support the Maker token holders to develop, evaluate, and execute a strategy to capitalize on the economic and political benefits of high-quality real-world assets, whether the strategy is through MetaDAOs, the existing approach, or such other mechanism.
- Enable Maker to leverage its unique position within the crypto ecosystem to accelerate the transformation and transition of real-world assets into digital assets with oracles and liquidity.
- Use the **existing** financial resources allocated to RWF-001 (including FTEs) to maximize opportunities for Maker token holders to evaluate high-quality assets introduced by professional asset managers.
- Ensure that external legal resources are utilized judiciously and that the purpose and extent of expenditures are clearly communicated to the Maker token holders to ensure Core Unit accountability.
- Maximize transparency and communications with the Maker token holders and community via weekly office hours, brief weekly greenlit transaction updates, monthly Core Unit updates, and periodic strategy sessions.
- Ensure that existing and potential Maker’s customers have questions answered in a professional and timely manner. The existing and potential customer experience is critical to Maker’s success. A measured Core Unit Facilitator with substantial transaction deal-making background will enhance the Maker experience for potential and existing customers.
- Ensure weekly cross-Core Unit collaboration and communication to ensure that Maker token holders wishes are consistently executed by the Core Units and be accountable to the other Core Units for information, next steps and the like to ensure efficient execution.
