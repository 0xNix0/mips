## Sentence Summary

## Paragraph Summary

MIP41c5-SP7 voluntarily offboards @LongForWisdom, one of the active Facilitators of the GovAlpha Core Unit (GOV-001). This leaves GovAlpha facilitation in the hands of @prose11 until/if [MIP41c4-SP37](MIP41/MIP41c4-Subproposals/MIP41c4-SP37.md) passes (which would onboard @Patrick_J).

## Specification

### Motivation

As part of my original Governance Facilitator Onboarding Proposal, I stated the following:

> Once we have other Facilitators in place, I may re-evaluate (holding the position) and either decide to step down or aim to move into a different role.

\- [Onboarding Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip0c12-sp2-subproposal-for-core-personnel-onboarding-governance-facilitator/2351)

At the time of my posting this, we have one very capable Governance Facilitator in Prose, and a proposal up for a vote to onboard Patrick, who I expect to become equally capable very quickly.  

Given the current state of GovAlpha, I feel comfortable stepping down from the facilitator role. Thanks to all of you for your hard work and dedication to Governance in the DAO while I was a facilitator. 

I knew when I took on the role that it didn't particularly play to my strengths, and that I would eventually become frustrated with it. As GovAlpha (and the DAO as a whole) has grown, the role has become more about managing and directing other people versus working directly. 

In the near term, I plan to continue to do Governance work with GovAlpha as a contributor (though perhaps after a short break away from Maker). I want to stress that I'll be staying out of any decision-making or governance-procedural work within GovAlpha, and highlight that this will put me outside of the [neutrality mandate](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP3#govalpha-s-mandate) of GovAlpha Facilitators.

In the medium-long term, I'd like to continue to contribute to MakerDAO, potentially in other positions or on discrete initiatives that don't involve committing to ongoing responsibilities. If you are working on anything that has a well-defined end-point and you think it might interest me or would benefit from having my input, please let me know. 

I have no plans to work for any other DAO at this time. After all, Maker is where the action is.
