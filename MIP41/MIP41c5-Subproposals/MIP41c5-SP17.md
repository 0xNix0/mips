## Specification

### Motivation

It is with a mix of excitement and a tinge of sadness that I share my decision to step down from my role as a facilitator. Working with all of you over the past two years has been an incredible journey, witnessing the development of the DAO and contributing to its growth. However, with the recent re-organization of Maker under the Endgame, I strongly believe that now is the perfect time for me to embrace a new challenge and contribute to the exciting new stage as part of one of the EA, Phoenix Labs.

Under the Endgame's decentralized vision, Growth CU focus has shifted towards branding, a crucial aspect for Makerâ€™s continued success. After careful consideration, I have come to the realization that Mariano is the ideal candidate to lead the Growth team and help Maker with its branding efforts. His expertise and passion make him well-suited for this role, and I have complete confidence in his abilities. I am truly eager to support Mariano in his new position as he leads the team into this promising new chapter.

I want to express my deepest gratitude to the Growth team. I look forward to continuing our collaboration in different capacities and witnessing the ongoing success of Maker.
