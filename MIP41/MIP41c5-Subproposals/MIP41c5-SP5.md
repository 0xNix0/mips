## Sentence Summary

This subproposal is to offboard the current Facilitators of the MakerDAO Shop.

## Specification

### Motivation

Experiments are great in every organisation. This becomes truer for web3 and truest for MakerDAO.
That being said, when an experiment is not killed in time, it becomes a money pit or a missed opportunity. 

Several strong reasons indicate that this is a good time to release this team from their duties:

#### Lack of Quality

This point might be hard to qualify or quantify when a shop is up and running. Ultimately it comes down to the metrics. The meme Wizard has done much better things and there are groups interested in making swag great again.

#### Lack of Service

It has been reported by several community members that the site has been down for weeks, which is unacceptable at any point in time after 1997. 

#### Lack of Accountability

This team promised 50% of the revenue of the shop, and they have vested approximately 0 Dai to the Protocol. We probably don't care that much, but not delivering on a promise should have some consequences. Reputation?

### Conclusion

After wasting everyone's time and delivering zero results --both in terms of branding or monetary-- we need to remove this team to allow for space so that other teams can grow into it. This team representing Maker is enough to discourage new talent from joining the DAO. The quality bar needs to be several miles higher.
