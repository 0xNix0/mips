## Sentence Summary

This subproposal is to offboard the current Facilitator of the Data Insights Core Unit (DIN-001).

## Paragraph Summary

This MIP will offboard me, Tomasz Mierzwa, as the Facilitator of the Data Insights Core Unit.
It is accompanied by [MIP41c4-SP35](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip41c4-sp35-facilitator-onboarding-for-din-001/14948) to onboard Tadeo (@tadeo) as the new Facilitator.

Together, these two MIPs complete the voluntary transfer of the responsibilities of the Data Insights Core Unit Facilitator from Tomasz Mierzwa to Tadeo.

## Specifications

### Motivation

A few months ago, when I took on this role, I was motivated to bootstrap the Data Insights Core Unit and make it operational and successful. From the beginning, I declared only a part-time involvement (0.25 FTE) because of my other duties and responsibilities. My mission to create this Core Unit is completed now, and I’d like to step down from the Facilitator role to hand it over to another team member who can ensure 100% involvement.

Tadeo proved from the very beginning that he is an ideal candidate for a full-time Facilitator. He is a great guy, very passionate and highly involved, and experienced with data-related technologies and products. What’s even more important, he has great communication and organisational skills.

I’m not leaving the team. I’ll still be involved in the advisory role helping with strategy, product planning, design, data sourcing, and data quality control.

The Data Insights Core Unit is and will be my beloved child, and I’m confident that I leave it in the right hands :muscle:
