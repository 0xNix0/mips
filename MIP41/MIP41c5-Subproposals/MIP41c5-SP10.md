## Sentence Summary

The services provided by Immunefi do not require a Core Unit, which requires additional personnel overhead and governance resources.

## Motivation

See the [sister subproposal](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp77-modify-is-001-budget/16436) to remove the budget from this Core Unit. These services can more nimbly and cheaply be carried out without a Core Unit structure. Severance is included in the budget offboarding subproposal for both contributors.

## Core Unit ID

IS-001
