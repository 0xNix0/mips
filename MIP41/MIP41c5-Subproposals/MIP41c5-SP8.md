## Sentence Summary

I'm sure these are nice people, but this core unit is not needed and [severance has been proposed](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-spxx-modify-core-unit-budget-for-events-001/15991).

## Motivation

See the [sister subproposal](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-spxx-modify-core-unit-budget-for-events-001/15991) to remove the budget from this Core Unit. This Core Unit is simply not needed anymore. Severance is included in the budget offboarding subproposal for both facilitators.

## Core Unit ID

EVENTS-001
