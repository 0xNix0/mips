## Sentence Summary

MIPX sets processes for MakerDAO to manage which actors have control of which digital assets (such as web-domains, github repositories and social media accounts).

## Paragraph Summary

MIPX sets processes for MakerDAO to manage which actors have control of which digital assets (such as web-domains, github repositories and social media accounts). These processes are designed to be as lightweight as possible, requiring intervention by Maker Governance only in the case of disagreement between actors over the control of digital assets. Included is a set of transparency requirements for actors to meet when control changes, and an active list detailing which actors have control of which assets.

## Component Summary

**MIPXc1: Assumptions**  
MIPXc1 defines the assumptions made by MIPX and clarifies what actions it does and does not cover.

**MIPXc2: Digital Asset List**  
MIPXc2 defines a list of digital assets owned by MakerDAO and details the both the purpose and controller of the asset.

**MIPXc3: Agreed Modification of Control**  
MIPXc3 defines the requirements for an agreed modification of control of one or more digital assets owned by MakerDAO.

**MIPXc4: Contested Modification of Control**  
MIPXc4 is a process component which allows authors to appeal to Maker Governance to resolve a contested moficiation of control of one or more digital assets owned by MakerDAO.

## Motivation

- A short description of the motivation behind the MIP. 

## Specification / Proposal Details

### MIPXc1: Assumptions**  
MIPX assumes a few things regarding control and ownership of digital assets within MakerDAO.

**Assumption #1**
MIPX assumes that some 'owning entity' exists which retains 'owner-control' of DAO owned digital assets. 'Owner-control' is defined as the power to forcably remove control of a digital asset from the controlling entity and transfer it to a new controlling entity. 

At the time of writing this MIP, the 'owning entity' for many of MakerDAO's digital assets is the DAI Foundation.

**Assumption #2**
MIPX assumes that MakerDAO actors usually have positive relationships with one another and are able to come to mutually satisfactory resolutions in almost all cases of control-transfer.

**Assumption #3**
MIPX assumes that there are sufficient MakerDAO actors to meet the transparency requirements defined in MIPXc2.

### MIPXc2: Digital Asset List

#### vote.makerdao.com
> **Asset Type:** Subdomain  
> **Controller:** DUX Incubating Core Unit  
> **Purpose:** Provide a safe way for Maker Governance to take part in the governance of MakerDAO.  

etc...

### MIPXc3: Agreed Modification of Control

An agreed modification of control refers to an uncontested and mutually agreed-upon transfer of control of a digital asset owned by MakerDAO. 

A subproposal is not required for an agreed modification of control.

In order for a modification of control to be valid under this component, it must meet the following requirements:

**Transparency**  
An agreed mofication of control must be made publicly accessible to Maker Governance. It must remain publicly accessible for at least one week before being considered valid and actioned by the relevant 'owner-control'.

**Supported**  
An agreed modification of control must be publicly supported by at least three Core Unit Facilitators as defined in MIP41. 

In the case that a digital asset is currently controlled by one or more actors, the controlling actor(s) must support the modification of control in order for it to be valid under this component. 

**Uncontested**  
An agreed modification of control must not be publicly contested by any Core Unit Facilitators as defined in MIP41.

An agreed modification of control must not be publicly contested by Maker Governance. Maker Governance can use MIP24c4 to express contention quickly.

**Well Defined**  
An agreed modification of control must include a listed purpose for the asset and reasoning for why the change in controllers is desirable. It must also clearly list a contact for the digital asset.
