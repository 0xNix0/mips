## Sentence Summary

MIP81 will onboard an account representing MakerDAO to Coinbase Prime and transfer 33% / ~1.6B of the PSM’s USDC into custody to earn USDC rewards with Coinbase.

## Paragraph Summary

MIP81 onboards a portion of the PSM’s USDC to Coinbase Prime in order to participate in Coinbase’s USDC Institutional Rewards program. This MIP outlines the terms for reward calculation and the process for payment to MakerDAO through 2022.

## Motivation

This proposal responds to the ratified Declaration of Intent [MIP13c3-SP12: Invest in Short-term Bonds](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP13c3SP12) , wherein MakerDAO governance requested that collateral assets be deployed in a manner that incorporates evaluative criteria of: safety, cost structure, and flexibility. Coinbase is uniquely situated to offer a USDC Rewards Program to MakerDAO that meets this evaluative criteria. Specifically, Coinbase is an established, reputable, and regulated company.

- Coinbase has been a longstanding partner of Maker’s, most recently collaborating with the Growth Core Unit (GRO-001) and the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001) to understand what opportunities would be of interest to the broader DAO community.
- Maker’s balance sheet is largely exposed to USDC --- in exchange for zero holding reward.
- Maker believes it is beneficial to safely be rewarded for holding collateral in USDC.
- This MIP outlines a clear path to providing up to 1.5% APY on USDC in the form of USDC Rewards and optimizing liquidity at zero cost to, and industry-leading security for, Maker.
