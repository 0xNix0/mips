MIP39c2-SP12 adds Collateral Onboarding Core Unit, COB-001.

## Specification

### Motivation

MakerDAO and the ecosystem is faced with several critical supply side issues.

At the moment, the pace of innovation in the cryptocurrency industry is outstripping our ability to keep up with it. To thrive in today's market, we not only have to maintain our first mover position, we need to continue increase the velocity of innovation to prevent an existential threat lurking amongst current DeFi players and entry by traditional finance.

The other issue is, how do we systematically attract and onboard the trillions of dollars of assets represented in the real world? We are off to a good start as the community is experimenting in different asset classes, with more approaches in the pipeline. Overall, the future growth and long-term success of the protocol is dependent upon the inclusion of a wide range of off-chain assets.

Simply put, it is imperative to have a Core Unit solely focused on the collateral onboarding aspects of the Maker protocol. Since the MCD launch, we have done a great job with the resources available to us. Now, it's time to greatly improve upon our capabilities to reach one trillion Dai and beyond. Focus is the only way to reach and exceed our supply goals.

### Core Unit Mandate

The Collateral Onboarding Core Unit (COB) is a crucial aspect of growing MakerDAO and central to the protocol's success. Onboarding diverse and quality collateral assets to the Maker Protocol scales-up Dai availability, increases the demand for Dai, supports financial inclusion, and ultimately helps mitigate risk while maintaining Dai stability. Moreover, a formalized and public collateral onboarding process upholds the DAO’s principles of complete transparency and accountability to the Maker community.

The mission of the Collateral Onboarding Core Unit is to 1) Scale the Dai supply and reduce risk using desirable and diverse collateral, 2) Build, deliver, and operate the infrastructure for critical and sustainable core collateral onboarding services, and 3) Uphold the [MakerDAO core principles](https://blog.makerdao.com/foundation-proposal-v2/).

The Collateral Onboarding Core Unit vision focuses on the five core DAO principles.

1. **Driving Dai Adoption** -- The inclusion of diverse and desirable collateral types in the Maker Protocol increases the supply, attractiveness, market usage, and ultimately, the demand for the Dai stablecoin.

2. **Scientific Governance** -- The diversity of the collateral assets of the Maker protocol reduce the portfolio's risk inherent in relying heavily on a single collateral type. The natural byproduct of diversity helps maintain the stability of Dai.

3. **Gradual Decentralization** -- By deploying MakerDAO capital to build, scale, and leverage the collateral onboarding infrastructure, we normalize the process and costs associated with onboarding collateral.

4. **Serving The Underserved** -- Support the financially underserved through the use of Dai as a predictable and stable unit of account. As we term it, “to be the world’s unbiased currency”. Sensitivities to localized collateral help with inclusion and access to the global financial ecosystem.

5. **Sustainable Finance** -- The makeup of the Dai collateral portfolio has a significant impact on global capital allocation. It is therefore crucial that governance of the collateral portfolio take long-term societal, environmental, and sustainability impact into account.

The Core Unit Mandate focuses on three distinct areas: Dai supply, collateral infrastructure, and DAO principles.

#### Scale the Dai supply

*Assist in scaling the Dai supply and reduce risk using desirable and diverse collateral.*

Every organization, regardless of structure, has two general categories of function: 1) cost centers and 2) revenue generators. The Collateral Onboarding Core Unit is specifically focused on supporting **revenue generation** for MakerDAO.

To be very clear, collateral onboarding is the foundational activity that makes ***everything*** about the protocol work. It is important not to lose sight of this key fact and to be grounded in the realities of what’s required to create a systematic and repeatable process. This is priority number one for the protocol.

As we exhaust the current supply of crypto collateral, the maturity of the protocol’s lending system relies on the diversification of collateral. We are all aware of the focus on real world assets to fuel the growth of the protocol. We are also going to see many competing methods for onboarding real world assets which is a sign of healthy ecosystem growth.

The growth will not happen organically. If so, we will lose the competitive edge of our first mover advantage as we’ve all grown to know and love. The heart of attracting individuals and organizations to the protocol is a strong incentive system. If high-quality collateral is onboarded, compensation is made when demand kicks in which leads to growth. No demand, no growth, and no payment.

What is high-quality collateral? The question can be answered when looking at the asset economics, risk, and DAO principles. The Collateral Onboarding is the core guardian of how collateral makes its way into the protocol.

#### Build, deliver, and operate the infrastructure

*Build, deliver, and operate the infrastructure for critical and sustainable core collateral onboarding services.*

The heart of the collateral infrastructure mandate is about building and maintaining systematic and repeatable processes. With over 4 Billion Dai minted, any mistake impacts the integrity of the protocol. The way we mitigate infrastructure risk is to put healthy systems and guardrails in place along with the appropriate oversight structures.

This is not done in isolation as Collateral Onboarding Core Unit has dependencies across many Core Units. As we move further into decentralization, ensuring we have diversity in the roles and responsibilities across our Core Units is a key aspect of the work we do. At times, this will be competitive and that competition is encouraged.

Diversification also introduces a large reliance on communication and collaboration. From the beginning, these are key cornerstones of the Collateral Onboarding Core Unit. Initially, there is a heavy reliance on other Core Units providing hands-on collateral onboarding services. The goal is to create more autonomy for the Collateral Onboarding Core Unit, along with the proper checks and balances, to systematically onboard collateral. Enabling third-party collateral providers is a key element of this mandate.

Another key aspect of building infrastructure is the people within the Core Unit. The hard skills are equally important as the soft skills. Team building is more of an art than a science and attracting and retaining highly motivated people, with the required aptitude, competency, and trust is critical to the success of a Core Unit.

#### Uphold DAO principles

*Uphold the five MakerDAO core principles.*

The heart of any organization is the culture and principles used as guiding principles to benefit all stakeholders. Recently, there have been a few discussions for the vision of the DAO and the purpose we serve. It appears that our preference as a community is to create and run an economic system for the purpose of greater good vs. pure revenue generation.

At the present moment, the Collateral Onboarding Core Unit plans to use the five DAO principles voted on during the time the Foundation was formed. These principles will serve as a lense to shape our decision making relating to collateral onboarding. Part of the Collateral Onboarding Core Unit’s mission is to be a guardian of the principles to ensure we are being true to our community and stated mandates.

### Team Structure

The Collateral Onboarding Core Unit will continuously work with Protocol Engineering, Oracles, Risk, Real World Finance, and other critical stakeholders to identify the initial and future key responsibilities for this Core Unit. The transition of responsibilities will be gradual and based upon competency, quality, and trust factors.

As an example, the Collateral Onboarding Core Unit emulates the Protocol Engineering Core Unit in many aspects. Today, [Collateral Onboarding](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP39/MIP39c2-Subproposals/MIP39c2-SP7.md#collateral-onboarding) is one of the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's Core Mandates. It's highly probable you will see a similar Collateral Onboarding Core Mandate in an upcoming Oracles Core Unit MIP. Portions of these responsibilities are obvious initial targets for inclusion into the Collateral Onboarding Core Unit.

The Collateral Onboarding Team scales based upon the responsibilities of this Core Unit. A Facilitator will be onboarded and this person answers to the community of MKR holders. A Product and Engineering team will be hired. This consists of a combination of permanent Core Unit team members and new ecosystem engineers training on the Maker protocol. One example might be a feeder system from the SES Core Unit to onboard new engineers into the Maker ecosystem.

The challenge the Collateral Onboarding Core Unit faces is hiring permanent team members with a background in software architecture and/or software engineering with a comprehensive understanding of blockchain fundamentals, security architecture, consensus algorithms, formal modeling and verification, and smart contract Solidity/Ethereum development experience. We seek to balance the needs of the community, collateral onboarding objectives/outcomes, and the Core Unit to attract, hire, and retain top talent as it relates to compensation and incentive structures.

### Responsibilities

The three initial responsibilities of the Collateral Onboarding Core Unit focus on are:

1. **People**: Establish and operate the Core Unit team

2. **Infrastructure**: Iterate and build a collateral onboarding assembly line

3. **Autonomy**: Experimentation and scaling for collateral onboarding

Each of these areas will be expanded upon and included in weekly updates, objectives and key results, and a pipeline to show future priorities. This activity will happen once the initial responsibilities and timeline is agreed upon by the critical stakeholders.

The Collateral Onboarding Team will also adopt the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's **Working Philosophy** and **Ways of Working & Team Rituals**. Both have been slightly modified and included in this MIP (below) for completeness.

### Working Philosophy

*DeFi is an experimental landscape where change is constant and the cost of failure is very high.*

Due to the complexity of this work and associated risk, there are certain working philosophies that need to be followed. As a team, we will embrace the notion of paired programming, and asynchronous peer reviews to deliver space-grade code. As part of our day-to-day, we:

* Maintain an open forum for discussion, collaboration and learning
* Are unafraid to voice concerns, risks or limitations when discussing enhancements or changes
* Adhere to industry standards such as ensuring passing unit tests before deploying any code
* Modularize code to keep contracts simple and the attack surfaces small
* Maintain active relationships with auditors and support community bug bounties
* Keep a tight coupling with the Risk Team, Protocol Engineering, Oracles, other key stakeholders, and the community to manage protocol risk exposure
* Where possible, open source our code for broader adoption and to promote ecosystem growth
* Aim to constantly raise the bar for safety and correctness, setting the standard for excellence in protocol design and implementation

### Ways of Working & Team Rituals

The Collateral Onboarding Team will operate on a two week sprint cadence allowing us to be responsive to community votes and market changes. Our commitment to clarity and transparency shall be accomplished with the following:

* **Weekly Protocol Engineering Team Update:** a Governance and Risk call presentation covering progress, including; achievements, challenges, roadblocks.

* **Quarterly Objectives and Key Results:** Manage a product backlog, sprint goals, and team priorities to help drive focus and alignment with other domain teams.

* **Management of a R&D Backlog:** As a mechanism to communicate and discuss what innovative projects we feel are important to help drive further advances with collateral onboarding.

The intention is that through these recurring rituals our stakeholders will be well informed with respect to what this team has achieved, what they are currently working on as well as any upcoming initiatives.
