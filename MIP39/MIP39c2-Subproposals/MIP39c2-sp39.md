## Sentence Summary

MIP39c2-SP39 modifies the mandate of SAS-001: Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit.

## Motivation
With the Pregame many things for SAS changed. We broadly expanded our CU work scope to maximize our effectiveness for the DAO. In the past months Auctions and Liquidations became a smaller fraction of our daily work.

We've described our expanded work scope in our [new budget MIP](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp95-modifying-sidestream-auction-services-core-unit-budget-sas-001/19737) and in our 2 recent monthly Updates 

During the RFC phase **we hope to receive feedback from MKR holders**, whether an official update of our mandate is helpful or if the explanations in the other documents are sufficient.

If the the official mandate update is helpful, we'll collect all relevant information from other public documents in this MIP during the RFC phase.
