## Sentence Summary

MIP39c2-SP36 adds Core Unit SF-001: Strategic Finance Core Unit.

## Paragraph Summary

MIP39c2-SP36 adds Core Unit SF-001: Strategic Finance Core Unit. Its mission is to provide financial reporting and analysis to assist the DAO in evaluating the financial health of the protocol to enable strategic decision making and allocate capital more effectively.

## Specification

### Motivation

The Strategic Finance Core Unit Mandate is modified as a part of the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set in order to eliminate any possible risk of the collateral onboarding process becoming disrupted or blocked by the removal of the old MIP6 process.

The updated mandate is written with a new approach where the critical element of the mandate that explicitly and directly impacts Facilitator Governance Powers are provided up front. This information is also described as short and succinct as possible in order to make it completely clear what Governance Privileges the Core Unit Facilitator will have with regards to proposing non-standard weekly polls as defined in MIP16.

### Core Unit ID

SF-001

### Core Unit Name

Strategic Finance

### Core Unit Facilitator

Mark Phillips (@Aes)

### Core Unit Mandate

### Mandate as it relates to Facilitator Governance Powers

The Strategic Finance Core Unit Mandate makes the Strategic Finance Core Unit Facilitator also able to unilaterally, and with no additional process, propose non-standard weekly polls and Executive Votes related to:
* RWA Collateral management
* Risk parameter changes for RWA Collateral
* Other Risk Parameters in the Maker Protocol
* RWA collateral onboarding
* RWA Collateral offboarding
* Other votes and governance actions related to risk, Dai collateral, and risk parameters
* Any other votes and governance actions related to content described in the Informational Mandate below

### Informational Mandate
This section contains additional in depth information about the Strategic Finance Core Unit Mandate

#### Mission

Provide financial reporting and analysis to assist the DAO in evaluating the financial health of the protocol to enable strategic decision making and allocate capital more effectively.

#### Vision

Our vision is to provide the most accurate and clear financial reporting across the entire crypto industry, leveraging the transparency and immutability of the public blockchain to ultimately provide financials data that exceeds the requirements of IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards). Additionally, we seek to provide the DAO and MakerDAO stakeholders with relevant financial information to help assess the health of the protocol. We will accomplish this by:

- Providing clear, easily digestible financial information to the DAO that enables stakeholders to make informed decisions for the protocol
- Building financial dashboards and tools that provide real-time financial data directly from the blockchain so stakeholders can understand the health of the protocol
- Partnering with SES Core Unit to implement standardized and automated expense reporting vs budgets
- Collaborating with Growth and Risk Core Units to provide financial analysis of prospective deals
- Working with the Protocol Engineering and Oracle Core Units to model growth opportunities and risks
- Asset-liability management and innovation through investing protocol assets to generate yield (real-world assets, DeFi, etc.)
- Facilitating recurring strategic reviews to set a strategic action plan
- Accounting, solvency, liquidity, and potential regulatory reporting

### Strategy & Current Work

SF encompasses the traditional finance functions, including financial reporting, planning, analysis, and accounting, as well as an advisory component that helps facilitate consensus around the DAO's strategic priorities. This work, as detailed below and in the 'RWF Efforts' section, will be continued with the approval of the SF Core Unit. This work includes but is not limited to:

- Publishing Monthly Financial Statements
- Posting Monthly Financial Reports
- Reporting Actual Monthly Expenses & Forecasting by Core Unit
- Partnering with GRO-001 Facilitator and RISK-001 Facilitators to negotiate terms for the Nexo Institutional Vault as well as another 600M+ undisclosed prospective IV customer
- Maintenance of the Real-Time Financial Dashboard
- Forecasting Revenue and Profitability
- Analyzing Profitability by Vault
- Building new SQL queries to support the Strategic Focus Areas for the Recurring Strategy Reviews and KPIs

Our approach to working with the DAO is focused on collaboration. We believe partnering with the other Core Units and MKR holders, with each bringing our strengths and expertise to the table will yield multiplicative benefits compared to working purely in silos. This does not mean the Core Unit is dependent on other Core Units to execute the current work and envisioned scope; only that results will be maximized through collaboration. This collaboration is already happening today and will only get better moving forward.

### Roadmap

SF-001 will initially focus on continuing to build a solid financial reporting foundation and continue its work on the [RWF FP&A roadmap](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwf-financial-planning-analysis-roadmap/9756), prioritizing work based on community feedback.

- Asset-Liability Management:
    - Reporting of the current and future balance sheet structure in terms of interest rate, duration, maturity and profitability
    - Researching and proposing ways to optimize the balance sheet allocation

#### Proposals and Funnel (pipeline) Management

Strategic Finance Core Unit will evaluate the current off-chain and on-chain (ETH/ETH-derived, D3Ms, PSMs and assets with revenue potential above 1 million per year) ecosystem to propose to onboard or offboard assets into or out of the Maker Ecosystem, based on the current and sought risk for Maker as a whole.

Strategic Finance Core Unit will have discretion in managing the pipeline in terms of prioritization and resources dedicated to the aforementioned process.

### Domain Evolution

The Strategic Finance Core Unit aims to build a solid financial foundation for the DAO that enables the creation and growth of other specialized financial Core Units with expertise in diverse areas of finance. Some examples include Corp Dev (M&A), Asset-Liability Management, Treasury, Accounting, Audit, and Governance Relations.
