## Sentence Summary

This is an offboarding proposal for the GovComms core unit that includes both severance and retroactive MKR compensation.

## Specification

### Core Unit ID

COM-001

### Motivation

MakerDAO is restructuring in accordance with the Endgame Plan. With the rejection of our last budget proposal, we’ve been advised that work related to our mandate will be better executed as an ecosystem actor or as an in-house function within alternative stakeholder groups. The rejection of our budget proposal did not come with a complementary offboarding proposal, so we are putting it up ourselves. This core unit should be formally offboarded to support the transition, formalize the status of the team, and provide any severance and retroactive benefits due to contributors.

### Facilitator

With the offboarding of this Core Unit, the offboarding of the Facilitator is implied.

### Core Unit Unwinding -- Work

The active facilitator, @Davidutro, will execute the unwinding of the Core Unit with expected completion by the end of January 2023.

1. Administrative responsibilities
* The last contributor invoices will be paid during the first week of January.
* Financial statements for both December and January will be published.
* An agreement will be made with accountable to administer the severance package in February, assuming this proposal passes.
* All excess funds will be returned from AccountAble and the Operational Multisig.
* The Continuous Operations Multisig will have its funds returned.
* An agreement will be made for the Ambassador Program multisig to replace us.
* We will verify that all intangible assets are properly licensed, and that any transferable assets be transferred to the appropriate parties (Dai Foundation or GovAlpha).

2. Active Programs
* Following the budget rejection, we worked with the GovAlpha Core Unit to transition the critical and most valuable parts of our work. We are on track to close or transition all of our work by the end of December.

### Core Unit Unwinding -- Funds

#### One-time expense associated with unwinding

* 2x $350 offboarding charges from payroll provider.
* Severance Packages for full time team members.
* Retroactive MKR benefit compensation.
* January compensation for Facilitator.
* January expense for Accountable & Payroll Service.

#### Severance

These amounts will be transferred through the Executive Vote that follows the ratification of this proposal, contingent upon the completion of the Core Unit’s unwinding as signified by the successful transition of work items, return of all excess funds, publication of all financials, and the closure of the continuous operations multisig.

| Detail | Amount (DAI) |
|---|---|
| 3 months of Facilitator Compensation & Healthcare costs | 35950 |
| 3 months of PM Compensation & Healthcare costs | 24750 |
| Total | 60700 |

#### Retroactive MKR Compensation

##### Summary

Govcomms did not prioritize getting an MKR compensation package in place early on. Instead we decided to prioritize our actual work while waiting to see if a preferred standard would emerge by the end of the year. That never happened and so we planned to publish our proposal, modelled after [GovAlpha’s](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP60), for RFC in December 2022 so it could be voted on in January, in time for what would have been our first 1-year cliff vest in February(under the GovAlpha model). With the Core Unit being defunded, we instead added our MKR compensation here as a part of our offboarding.

##### Formula

MKR Compensation will be derived based on the salary earned within the Core Unit during the retroactive eligibility period. This proposal would compensate our team members in MKR in the amount of x% of the DAI earned during the eligibility period. This figure will be divided by the moving average of MKR over the eligibility period to derive the MKR token amount for each contributor.

>We are polling voters before this proposal is finalized, similar to what [GovAlpha did](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp60-modify-govalpha-core-unit-mkr-budget/13145/6) when they proposed their framework. See the poll in the comments below.

##### Sources and Data

Eligibility Period - From our inception to the last day we are approved to spend budgeted funds: August 1st, 2021 through December 31st, 2021

Salary - This is derived from our accounting records:
David: 170,000
Artem: 108,333

MKR Moving Average - Is derived from the "Close" price on CoinGecko (latest data point per day, UTC), taking the average closing price for that eligibility period. The dates from 12-5-22 through 12-31-22 will use $650 as an average price for now, with the actual numbers being added before formal submission([spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YqExo-6-uVrXQoAkhayO5ZrupwxDZlxPnIHvA1TXWkw/edit?usp=sharing)):
Price: $1411.13

Lockup - None. We are voiding the lockup period as a part of our offboarding.

MKR Transfer - Both full time team members will have their MKR transferred to their individual addresses.

##### MKR Payments

@Davidutro Retroactive MKR Payment:
TBD MKR sent from the Pause Proxy to Davidutro.eth (0xE896bCCE9fBb3341a1E98F98eC7a6FFbDEa35060)

@Artem_Gordon Retroactive MKR Payment:

#### Possible remedy to avoid offboarding

None.
