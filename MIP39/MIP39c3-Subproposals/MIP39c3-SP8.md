## Sentence Summary
This post notifies Governance of Collateral Engineering Services (CES-001) end of operations.

## Paragraph Summary
With Core Units winding down, we are formally notifying Governance of our voluntary offboarding. Our core unit mandate is carried on by Dewiz.

## Specification

### Motivation

### Core Unit Offboarding
* CES does not have an active Dai budget. 
* CES has completed supporting Dewiz's Ecosystem Actor startup activities.
* Dewiz is fully operational, and fulfilling more than CES's mandate.
* CES members have received their latest, on-schedule MKR vest. Our still active [MIP40c3-SP57](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP57) can now be marked obsolete, along with [MIP39c2-SP37](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP37) & [MIP41c4-SP40](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP41c4SP40) cc: @MIP-Editors 

## Core Unit Unwinding 
### Work 
BA Labs took over the primary role on CMON coordination at the start of the year. 

All other CES work is fully supported by @Dewiz.

### Funds
CES is in the final stages of review for our [SES-audit](https://expenses.makerdao.network/core-unit/CES/finances/reports?searchText=ces&section=mkr-vesting&viewMonth=Feb2023). CES concluded operations with 774,757 Dai remaining from our MIP40 between the [Auditor](https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=eth:0x25307aB59Cd5d8b4E2C01218262Ddf6a89Ff86da) & [Operational](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0xD740882B8616B50d0B317fDFf17Ec3f4f853F44f) wallets.

#### CES runway transfer to Dewiz 
* Dewiz has not received any seed or runway funding outside of the Ecosystem Incubator's DssVest stream. 
* Dewiz has filled a primary role in the [Spell Coordination process](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/spell-coordination-work/20475) in response to [PE's departure from the DAO](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/protocol-engineering-core-unit-transition/20327), requiring flexible access to funds to respond to emergency situations.
* The [Dewiz Warchest](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x28B02a2a1862399620363aa9D71dD0D01C6e65d9) represents a runway for the independent organization, enabling them to show stability to future hires and top talent, and avoid disruptions in operations due to potential governance or Support Scope delays. 

A transfer of 3 months runway (450,00 Dai) has been sent to Dewiz's Warchest Wallet from the excess of CES funding. 

#### CES Funds returned to the Surplus Buffer
The remainder of CES's budget has been returned to `DssBlow`. The return of 324,757 Dai was made to the protocol via DssBlow. This final transfer resulted in a total of 999,288 Dai returned by CES since preparing for the Endgame pivot in January of this year. 

### Facilitator 
The CES Facilitator does not have any Endgame responsibilities and MIP41c4-SP40 can also now be marked obsolete. 

@Retro has been supporting Dewiz as an advisor during the past several months. He will refocus on Ecosystem Support scope work moving forward. 

#### Possible Remedy to Avoid Offboarding
See you in Endgame. 

### Core Unit ID
- CES-001
