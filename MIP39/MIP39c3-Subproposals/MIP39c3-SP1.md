## Sentence Summary

This subproposal is to offboard the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001).

## Paragraph Summary

[TBD]

## Specification

### Motivation

SF-001 became increasingly more expensive without showing much value. A blurry mandate produces experiments that can be waste of time and risky projects.

> "We’re building something here, Detective. We’re buildingit from scratch. All the pieces matter.” --- Det. Lester Freamon

#### Too Expensive in Times of Crisis

They advocate for bear market strategy and ask for cash like [Cutty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNC6xjmHOkI):
- [Latest DAI increase](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp69-modify-core-unit-budget-strategic-finance-sf-001/15090) : ≈+32%
- [MKR repricing](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp48-strategic-finance-unit-mkr-compensation-sf-001/12060/10) : ≈+270%

 SF-001 is supposed to be exemplary, yet their MKR policy is the worst of all the CUs: no cap, no limit, 2-month average only.

#### Lack of Professionalism / Misuse of Funds

The examples of their members behaving in [bad faith](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/unblocking-the-stalled-short-term-bonds-revenues-generating-initiatives/17073/20) (always with "data" that would make a conspiracy theorist blush) are everywhere in the forum.

[Misuse of funds](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/returning-excess-budget-from-rwf-in-dai-or-in-mkr/12643): In tradfi, using company funds granted for CU operations to buy shares will land you in jail --- in Maker it's all good, it seems.

#### Lack of Results

Things SF-001 did lately:
- MIP40 amendment [that changes dates to fit its own cycle](https://i.imgur.com/YbfvlcA.png).
- KPI suggestion.
- Lots of forum posting: Compared to other CUs, all the members hardly have time to do work.
- Lots of politics: @madshills confronted them and asked if the CU position was the official position since all the team was doing politics all the time.
- [Open source model](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-n6m-target-spend-level/17122#open-source-modelhttpsdocsgooglecomspreadsheetsd1ygfmjogh9mvkskqcd7s9x6ibedgj31credituspsharingouid105675567186538493394rtpoftruesdtrue-7). This is *accountantspeak* for a simple public spreadsheet.
- Lack of OKRs

### Conclusion

@aes alone was doing the same (productive) work before this CU became expensive. Now [their updates](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/reporting-for-strategic-finance-core-unit-may-june-and-july-2022/17037) look like GovComms', with no concrete result.


### Core Unit ID
