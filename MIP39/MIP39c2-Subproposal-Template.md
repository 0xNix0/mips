# MIP39c2: Adding/Modifying Core Units

[//]: # "These are comments that clarify the template. Remove them once they've been read."

[//]: # "When titling this subproposal, use: 'MIP39c2: Adding [Core Unit name]([Core Unit ID])' (or 'Modifying', as the case may be)"

[//]: # "Feel free to add new headers, but refrain from removing those included by default (unless the possibility is explicitely indicated) and from altering their order."

[//]: # "Please try to keep the blurb to a minimum, as it distracts both you and the readers from what's substantive; furthermore, it makes proposals longer than they could be, that is, more likely not to be read in full or with the due attention. There are many venues on which to promote the value of a Core Unit."

## Preamble

[//]: # "The subproposal number will be assigned by MIP Editors."

[//]: # "You can leave the Tags and Status fields blank."

[//]: # "Date Applied is the date on which the subproposal is posted in the forum."

[//]: # "Date Ratified will be added by MIP Editors after the vote, if successful."

## Sentence Summary

[//]: # "E.g., 'This subproposal adds Core Unit [Core Unit Name]([Core Unit ID])'"

## Paragraph Summary

[//]: # "E.g., 'This subproposal adds Core Unit [Core Unit Name]([Core Unit ID]), whose mission is to [...] with [Facilitator name] as its Facilitator'"

## Specification

### Motivation

[//]: # "Try to answer why adding this Core Unit, or modifying it, as the case may be, is useful or necessary."

[//]: # "E.g., 'It is a recurring, unaddressed problem for MakerDAO that subproposal templates lack clarifying built-in comments that help standardize the output subproposals; as a consequence of this lack, understanding a particular resulting subproposal demands from the reader a specific, idiosyncratic set of mental gymnastics that doesn't transfer to any other subproposal."

### Core Unit ID

[//]: # "The Core Unit ID is assigned by MIP Editors or Governance Facilitators for new Core Units. If modifying a Core Unit, specify its ID here."

### Core Unit Name

[//]: # "Write the name of the Core Unit. If onboarding a new Core Unit, try to make the name capture the essence of its activities. This header can be removed if modifying an existing Core Unit."

### Core Unit Mandate

[//]: # "The Core Unit Mandate is the broad scope of what problems the Core Unit must solve, and what must be operated and maintained for the Core Unit to contribute to the success of the project."

[//]: # "The Core Unit Mandate should be specific enough to ensure that Maker Governance has clarity about what problems it is solving when delegating resources to the Core Unit."

[//]: # "Beyond that, the Core Unit Mandate should be as broad as possible in order to leave room for Facilitators to implement a flexible approach to solve the problems as the environment change."

[//]: # "The Core Unit Mandate can also contain directives, guidelines or suggestions from Governance that helps inform Facilitators and Contributors of the Core Unit how to act in certain situations.	"
