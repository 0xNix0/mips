## Specification

### MIP104c1: Preamble

The Decentralized Collateral Scope defines the principles and processes for all activity related to Decentralized Collateral Management. This includes both decentralized collateral offered directly in Maker Core Vaults, as well as lines of credit to other entities that are collateralized only by decentralized assets. The Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework is constrained by the elements of the Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework.

### MIP104c2: Scope Framework Articles

#### 1: The Decentralized Collateral Advisory Council

##### 1.1: The Decentralized Collateral Advisory Council definition
The Decentralized Collateral Advisory Council is a group of Ecosystem Actors that have been approved by Maker Governance to carry out advisory work related to improving the content of the Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework.

##### 1.2: Decentralized Collateral Advisory Council membership management
Members of the Advisory Council are directly approved by Maker Governance through a governance poll, and must fulfill specific criteria.
* **1.2.1:** The Responsible Facilitators must ensure that potential Advisory Council Members can apply to be approved by Maker Governance, using an open process with clear instructions.
---
* **1.2.2:** During the early stages of the Pregame Launch, Decentralized Collateral Advisory Council Members can also be Decentralized Collateral Facilitators and can also use Advisory Council project funds to perform other tasks related to the Decentralized Collateral Scope.
---
* **1.2.3:** The Responsible Facilitators must periodically, when it is relevant, review the Advisory Council Applications, and if they find applications that are suitable, bring them to a vote through an MKR governance poll. Approved Advisory Council Members are added to **10.2.3.1:**.
---
* **1.2.4:** The Responsible Facilitators may, if they deem it necessary, hold a vote to remove an Advisory Council Member. If an Advisory Council Member has not done any paid work for the Scope for at least 1 year, then the Responsible Facilitators can choose to remove them at will, if they deem it necessary.
---
* **1.2.5:** The current approved Avisory Council Members are recorded in the soft element **1.2.5.1**.
	* **1.2.5.1:**

##### 1.3: Decentralized Collateral Advisory Council projects and funding
The Advisory Council is paid on a project basis to do specific work that improves all or specific parts of the Scope Framework.
* **1.3.1:** Each Quarter, if they deem it necessary, the Responsible Facilitators must solicit proposals and find one or more suitable Advisory Council Members to perform a project that will result in output that can be used to improve the Scope Framework. This work output will be presented to the CVC Subcommittee Meetings as the starting point for the CVC Scope Framework Position Documents. As many CVCs as possible should be supported this way, prioritized by the Responsible Facilitators.
* **1.3.2:** In case an ambiguous, uncertain or challenging situation arises related to the Scope Framework, the Responsible Facilitator may approach one or more Advisory Council Members to perform a reactive project that aims to specify the language of the Scope Framework to take into account the specific situation. The Responsible Facilitator can then directly propose the change to the Scope Framework in a weekly governance poll, quickly resolving the challenge.
* **1.3.3:** The Advisory Council may not produce work output that is directly compatible with the formatting of the Scope Framework. In this case the Responsible Facilitator must either transcribe it themselves, or hire an Ecosystem Actor to perform the transcription. This role does not require preapproval by Maker Governance.
* **1.3.4:** The Responsible Facilitators may also produce advisory input on the content of the Scope Framework themselves, as long as it is focused on improving process and governance content. They are prohibited from providing unilateral input on expert subject matter content.
* **1.3.5:** The Responsible Facilitators have a budget available to pay for Advisory Council Projects per quarter. All spending must be limited to only what is deemed necessary and with a high probability of producing clearly measurable value, and this must be transparently be accounted for in a forum post at least a week before any transaction occurs.
  * **1.3.5.1:**

#### 2: The Implementation of the Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework through Software

The Responsible Facilitators must in collaboration with the CVC Subcommittees, periodically review possibilities of integrating DAO toolkit innovation into the processes and content of the Scope Framework.

#### 3: Ordinary Core Vault Type management

##### 3.1: Risk parameters of Core Vaults
All Core Vaults must have a stability fee at least equivalent to the low risk collateral benchmark rate defined in **The Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework 3.3.2**
* **3.1.1:** The Responsible Facilitator must use the weekly governance cycle to submit executive votes that increases the Stability Fee of Core Vaults that are below the minimum Stability Fee.

##### 3.2: Minimum net surplus requirements for Ordinary Core Vaults
All Ordinary Core Vaults that aren't based on Strategic Collateral Asset Types must generate at least 1 million Dai per year in net surplus after maintenance, oracle and other expenses. If an Ordinary Core Vault is not generating the necessary minimum net surplus, it must be offboarded.

#### 4: Strategic Collateral Asset Types

##### 4.1: Strategic Collateral Asset Types
Strategic Collateral Asset Types are not subject to the requirements of **3.2**
* **4.1.1** Strategic Collateral Asset Types are specified in the soft element **4.1.1.1** and can be changed based on a Governance Poll by MKR holders initiated by the Responsible Facilitator.
  * **4.1.1.1:**

##### 4.2: Loss-making Strategic Collateral
In case a Strategic Collateral Asset Type is causing losses to the protocol after maintenance, oracle and other expenses are accounted for, the Responsible Facilitator must periodically make a proposal for MKR holders to remove the Strategic Collateral Asset Type from the list in **4.1.1.1**

#### 5: Decentralized Collateral Direct Deposit Module management

##### 5.1: Decentralized Collateral Direct Deposit Modules (DCDDM)
DCDDMs must provide a return at least equivalent to the low risk collateral benchmark rate defined in **The Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework 3.3.2**, and must earn the protocol a net surplus of at least 1 million Dai per year after maintenance, oracle and other expenses.

##### 5.2: SubDAO Decentralized Lending Module subsidy
SubDAO Decentralized Lending Modules can be subsidized with DCDDMs in order to ensure an active market with a minimum level of users exists. Such DCDDMs can have up to 200 million Debt Ceiling at the Subsidized rate. The subsidized rate is equivalent to the benchmark return of very low risk collateral as defined in **The Stability and Liquidity Scope 3.3.1**. During the Pregame this section can be applied to lending protocols that are under the control of Maker Governance, regulated by the Ecosystem Scope, and is being incubated for adoption by a future SubDAO as a part of an Incubation Cluster.

#### 6: Decentralized Fixed Rates Module management

##### 6: Decentralized Fixed Rates Module management
