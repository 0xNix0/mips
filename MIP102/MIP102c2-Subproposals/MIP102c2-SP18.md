## Specification

### Motivation

This subproposal will amend MIP104 to provide clarifying edits to [recently updated](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp4-mip-amendment-subproposals/20035) MIP104 5.1.2 and MIP104 5.1.4.

### Amended MIPs and Components

- MIP104, Section 5

### Amendment Pull Request

---

Two sections are modified by this amendment. If other MIP102c2 amendments are being voted upon in the same monthly cycle as MIP102c2-SP18, then MIP102c2-SP18 overwrites any other amendments passed concurrently for the two sections: 5.1.2 and 5.1.4.

### Summary of Changes

- Clarify the meaning of `stable asset` in 5.1.2
- Rephrasing of `standalone governance poll` vs previous `standalone vote`
- Fixed typos in 5.1.4.1
- Made the first sentence of 5.1.4.2 more closely match the first sentence of 5.1.4.3 in phrasing
- Other items?
