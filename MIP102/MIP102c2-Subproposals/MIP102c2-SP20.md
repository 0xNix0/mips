## Specification

A MIP102c2 Subproposal must be _either_ 1) an Article 1 Edit _or_ a 2) General Edit.

If your MIP102c2 Subproposal seeks to amend Article 1 of a Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact, it is considered an Article 1 edit and cannot seek to amend any content except for Article 1.

If your MIP102c2 Subproposal does not seek to amend Article 1 of a Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact, it is considered a General Edit. An MIP102c2 General Edit cannot modify Article 1 elements.

Please indicate in the Preamble whether your MIP102c2 Subproposal is an Article 1 Edit or a General Edit.

If you seek to make Article 1 edits as well as General Edits to an Alignment Artifact, you must submit two separate MIP102c2 Subproposals.

### Motivation

This subproposal seeks to make various updates to the Alignment Artifacts to prepare for Phase 1 of Endgame.
