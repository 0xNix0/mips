## Specification

### Motivation

Well, I do declare, in line with our quarterly AVC roundabout, this here little suggestion's aimin' to tweak **Article 1** of a few of them Alignment Artifacts, all to better our Maker Governance, don't ya know? We're gonna zero in on them MIPs that hold the Governance Scope, the Support Scope, and the Protocol Scope, 'cause these are the Scopes that'll be under the watchful eye of AVCs in the first 3 weeks of the fresh quarter.
