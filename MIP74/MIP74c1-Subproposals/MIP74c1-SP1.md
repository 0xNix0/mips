## Sentence Summary

Restart a micro-burn of MKR, at $100/day, from the surplus buffer as a display to current and prospective MKR holders that the protocol still intends to embrace this important feature of driving long-term value and return on investment to MKR holders.

## Paragraph Summary

As a community, I believe that we know a core part of the appeal of holding MKR tokens is the “burn” feature that should drive value to MKR holders over time. It makes sense why that feature is turned off right now… but I fear that if it is turned off for too long, current and especially prospective MKR investors may forget that it is a feature all together. At $100/day, the impact on our surplus buffer is not a material amount. Additionally, if we as a community believe that Maker is going to be successful, buying the MKR token at these price points should yield a beneficial return over the coming years.

## Motivation

- Send a clear message to MKR holders that the "burn feature" of this protocol is still an intended part of our future, even if it is practically suspended for now during this crypto bear market.
- Place a small amount of psychological pressure on those shorting MKR's token on the open market that the burn feature is indeed returning. MKR is not to be shorted with impunity.
- In the future, when we choose to increase the burn amount, it will be similar to a publicly traded company announcing an increased buyback of stock. This will allow us to show confidence in the future of the MKR token.
- Buying small quantities of MKR tokens at such a depressed price is likely to generate a positive return on this initiative when viewed a couple years from now.

Good Faith MKR Micro-Burn

## DssKiln Permissionless Open Market Operation Risks & Unwanted Outcomes

- Risk that the surplus buffer is entirely depleted and there are no funds to burn $100/day
- Risk that $100 is viewed negatively as being too small and becomes a discouragement rather than an encouragement to MKR holders
- Transaction costs of a $100/day burn may be too high of a percentage of the daily spend

## DssKiln Permissionless Open Market Operation Duration

- The intention is for this to be a permanent feature, but for the sake of having a termination provision, it can be set to run for five years.

## DssKiln Permissionless Open Market Operation General & Specific Parameters

- In order to minimize gas fees, the $100/day burn would be executed in a single transaction of $700/week. For purposes of branding/marketing, I think the concept of “$100/day” sounds better than “$700/week.” But in practical application, the transaction can occur once per week.
- Purchased on the open market
- The hop, lot, scope, and yen will be set by the Risk-001. The dollar amount is so low, allowing them professional discretion here is not of significant concern.

## DssKiln Permissionless Open Market Operation Amount Requested on Annual Basis, Schedule of Funds Deployment & Source of Funding
