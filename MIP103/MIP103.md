## MIP 1: The Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework Advisory Council

#### 1.1: The Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework Advisory Council definition
The Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework Advisory Council is a group of Ecosystem Actors that have been approved by Maker Governance to carry out advisory work related to improving the content of the Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework.

#### 1.2: Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework Advisory Council membership management
Members of the Advisory Council are directly approved by Maker Governance through a governance poll, and must fulfill specific criteria.
* **1.2.1:** The Responsible Facilitators must ensure that potential Advisory Council Members can apply to be approved by Maker Governance, using an open process with clear instructions.
---
* **1.2.2:** Advisory Council Members must be ecosystem actors that are not involved in any business activity that could result in a conflict of interest, either directly or indirectly. They must also have relevant skills for providing professional expert input on the content that the Stability and Liquidity Scope is covering.
---
* **1.2.3:** The Responsible Facilitators must periodically, when it is relevant, review the Advisory Council Applications, and if they find applications that are suitable, bring them to a vote through an MKR governance poll. Approved Advisory Council Members are added to **10.2.3.1:**.
---
* **1.2.4:** The Responsible Facilitators may, if they deem it necessary, hold a vote to remove an Advisory Council Member. If an Advisory Council Member has not done any paid work for the Scope for at least 1 year, then the Responsible Facilitators can choose to remove them at will, if they deem it necessary.
---
* **1.2.5:** The current approved Avisory Council Members are recorded in the soft element **1.2.5.1**.
	* **1.2.5.1:**
¤¤¤
Current list of Advisory Council Members:
N/A
¤¤¤

#### 1.3: Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework Advisory Council projects and funding
The Advisory Council is paid on a project basis to do specific work that improves all or specific parts of the Scope Framework.
* **1.3.1:** Each Quarter, if they deem it necessary, the Responsible Facilitators must solicit proposals and find one or more suitable Advisory Council Members to perform a project that will result in output that can be used to improve the Scope Framework. This work output will be presented to the CVC Subcommittee Meetings as the starting point for the CVC Scope Framework Position Documents. As many CVCs as possible should be supported this way, prioritized by the Responsible Facilitators.
* **1.3.2:** In case an ambiguous, uncertain or challenging situation arises related to the Scope Framework, the Responsible Facilitator may approach one or more Advisory Council Members to perform a reactive project that aims to specify the language of the Scope Framework to take into account the specific situation. The Responsible Facilitator can then directly propose the change to the Scope Framework in a weekly governance poll, quickly resolving the challenge.
* **1.3.3:** The Advisory Council may not produce work output that is directly compatible with the formatting of the Scope Framework. In this case the Responsible Facilitator must either transcribe it themselves, or hire an Ecosystem Actor to perform the transcribtion. This role does not require preapproval by Maker Governance.
* **1.3.4:** The Responsibel Facilitators may also produce advisory input on the content of the Scope Framework themselves, as long as it is focused on improving process and governance content. They are prohibited from providing unilateral input on expert subject matter content.
* **1.3.5:** The Responsible Facilitators have a budget available to pay for Advisory Council Projects per quarter. All spending must be limited to only what is deemed necessary and with a high probability of producing clearly measurable value, and this must be transparently be accounted for in a forum post at least a week before any transaction occurs.
	* **1.3.5.1:**
¤¤¤
The Advisory Council project budget is up to 500,000 Dai per quarter. It is accessible as a keg that refills at a linear rate of 500,000 per 3 months, and has a maximum limit of 500,000.

## 2: The Implementation of the Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework through Software
The Responsible Facilitators must in collaboration with the CVC Subcommittees, periodically review possibilities of integrating DAO toolkit innovation into the processes and content of the Scope Framework.

## 3: The general Asset-Liability Management model
#### 3.1: The general Asset-Liability Management model definition
The ALM model governs the overall duration risk of the Dai collateral portfolio, and its contents are implemented practically in the Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework and the Real World Asset Scope Framework.
#### 3.2: ALM categories and the ALM model implementation
The ALM model is based on categorizing the different types of collateral in the Dai Collateral portfolio, and assigning specific rules and percentages that the Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework and the Real World Asset Scope Framework must implement in practice.
* **3.2.1:** Variable Rate Decentralized Core Vaults are not counted as a part of the ALM-applied portfolio.
---
* **3.2.2:** The ALM-applied portfolio must target at least 20% combined exposure to Stablecoins. It may go above this amount when waiting to deploy assets into high-yield collateral.
	* **3.2.2.1:** As a subset, the ALM-applied portfolio must target 10% direct exposure to Cash Stablecoins.
	* **3.2.2.2:** * **3.2.2.1:** As a subset, the ALM-applied portfolio may target up to 10% direct exposure to Secondary Yield Stablecoins. These pay a yield, be possible to quickly convert into Cash Stablecoins, and must be potential future candidates for Cash Stablecoins that are valuable to incubate and use as redundant fallbacks.
	* **3.2.2.3:** As a subset, the remaining exposure must go to Primary Yield Stablecoins that pay a yield and can be converted into Cash Stablecoins within at most 12 hours.
		* **3.2.2.3.1:** A smart contract must be used to automatically move excess Cash Stablecoins into Yield Stablecoins, and automatically move Yield Stablecoins into Cash Stablecoins if it is below the target.
---
* **3.2.3:** The ALM-applied portfolio must target at most 80% combined exposure to High Yield Real World Assets and Decentralized Fixed Rate Collateral.
	* **3.2.3.1:** As a subset, the ALM-Applied Portfolio must target at most 12.5% exposure to collateral with a duration of 1-3 years, with a 2 year average duration. This can also be substituted for collateral with a shorter duration. Legacy Real World Asset Vaults count towards this limit.
	* **3.2.3.2:** As a subset, the ALM-Applied Portfolio must target at most 37.5% exposure to collateral with a duration of 6 months to 1 year, with a 9 month average duration. This can also be substituted for collateral with a shorter duration.
	* **3.2.3.3:** As a subset, the ALM-Applied Portfolio must target at most 30% exposure to collateral that can be converted to Cash Stablecoins within 7 days. This can also be substituted for collateral with a shorter duration.
#### 3.3: Benchmark rates
The benchmark rates are used to calculate the Dai Savings Rate, and used by the Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework to calculate Stability Fees and Target Return.
* **3.3.1:** The benchmark return for very low risk collateral is equivalent to the effective return on Primary Yield Stablecoin
---
* **3.3.2:** The benchmark return low risk collateral is equivalent to the effective return on the 3-month treasury bill.

 high yield real world asset collateral is the 3-month treasury bill

## 4: The Dai Savings Rate and Stability Fee Base Rate
#### 4.1: The Dai Savings Rate Definition
The Dai Savings Rate is a yield available to Dai holders that deposit their Dai into the Dai Savings Rate smart contract.
#### 4.2: The Dai Savings Rate parameter
During normal conditions the Dai Savings Rate is set as 90% of the benchmark return on very low risk collateral specified in **3.3.1**.
#### 4.3: Dai Savings Rate and Stability Fee Base Rate changes in demand shocks
In situations where Dai demand rapidly falls and the ALM-Applied Portfolio runs low of short duration assets, the Dai Savings Rate and Stability Fee Base Rate starts increasing.
* **4.3.1:** For each consecutive period where the direct exposure to Cash Stablecoins has continuously been below 5% of the total ALM-Applied Portfolio, the Responsible Facilitator can trigger an urgent executive vote to increase the Stability Fee Base Rate on all Core Vaults by up to 0.5% per consecutive 24 hour period, up to a maximum of 4%. This also increases the Dai Savings Rate proportionally, based on the proportion of Core Vault debt compared to the total supply of Dai.
	* **4.3.1.0:** *This is to ensure that the Dai Savings Rate doesn't go above what the Maker Protocol is earning on its collateral on average. Examples:*
		* **4.3.1.0.1:** *If the total Dai supply is 4 billion, and the total Core Vault debt is 1 billion, and an executive vote increases the Stability Fee Base rate by 4%, then the executive vote must also increase the Dai Savings Rate by 1%.*
* **4.3.2:** For each consecutive period where the direct exposure to Cash Stablecoins has continuously been above 5% of the total ALM-Applied Portfolio, the Responsible Facilitator can trigger an urgent executive vote to decrease the Stability Fee Base Rate on all Core Vaults by up to 1% per consecutive 24 hour period. This also decreases the Dai Savings Rate proportionally, based on the proportion of Core Vault debt compared to the total supply of Dai. If the Stability Fee Base Rate returns to 0%, then the Dai Savings Rate must also return to its value during normal conditions as defined in **4.2.**

## 5: The long duration asset haircut model and process
#### The long duration asset haircut model and process
If the effective Stability Fee of at least one Core Vault user has doubled as a result of a demand shock response as defined in **4.3**, then the Responsible Facilitators may submit a fire sale proposal to Maker Governance, enabling them to consider selling long duration assets at a potential haircut. The expected haircut, and other context including the current risk to the Dai peg, must be clearly explained as a part of the decision making process.

## 6: Preferential terms for strategic collateral
#### 6.1: Preferential terms for strategic collateral
The Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework and the Real World Asset Scope Framework can designate specific collateral types as strategic collateral. This makes only the benchmark rate of very low risk collateral apply to them defined in **3.3.1**. Any time this is used, it must done to a limited extent, and with clear justification and strategic goals that must be periodically revisited.
