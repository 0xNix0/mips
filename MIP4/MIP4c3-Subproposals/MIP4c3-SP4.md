## Specification

### Motivation

MIP65 requires a certification from the RWF-001 Facilitator and the "in SES-incubation" Facilitator of the prospective Legal and Transactional Services Core Unit (LTS). As the circumstances regarding RWF-001/LTS have changed, the RWF-001 Facilitator requests this certification requirement to be [moved elsewhere](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip65-monetalis-clydesdale-liquid-bond-strategy-execution/13148/112). This subproposal amends MIP65 accordingly.

### Amended Components

- MIP65: Monetalis Clydesdale: Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution
    - c1: MIP65c1: Legal Structure & Asset Strategy Conditions of the Collateral Onboarding
