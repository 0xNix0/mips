## Specification

### Motivation

- This MIP is being amended to become compatible with the Endgame Plan and prevent Signal Requests (non-standard weekly polls) from dominating the governance dynamic and acting as a vector for unpredictable complexity growth and governance overhead.
- This MIP Amendment only affects Signal Requests leading to non-standard weekly polls and doesn't change the standard and primary focus of MIP16

### Amended MIPs and Components

- MIP16
    - MIP16c1 (Add the following bullet points)
        - To protect the integrity of existing MIPs, Signal Requests are only permitted when they are specifically triggered and required by an existing MIP.
        - This component explicitly forbids the possibility of community-triggered Signal Requests about arbitrary issues. It is also explicitly specified that the only way to make arbitrary changes to Maker Governance is through the full MIPs process or through Governance Mandates of Mandated Actors.
