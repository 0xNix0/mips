## Specification

### Motivation

- Bureaucracy tends to grow without active pruning. The goal of the Retrospection Process is to surface a process to help prune unused or low-utility MIPs. This process also helps introduce and familiarize the broader community with MIPs that continue to be used.
- This change makes MIP0 depend on MIP4 for the removal process.

### Amended MIPs and Components

- Adds some components to MIP0 and amends MIP0c3 *The MIP Lifecycle*

### Amendment Pull Request

- [PR](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/pull/543)
