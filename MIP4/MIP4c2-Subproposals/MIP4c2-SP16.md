## Specification

### Motivation

This amendment for MIP55: Special Purpose Fund aims to improve the clarity of the original MIP text, allowing a clear distinction between which MIP55c3 subproposal may enter the Weekly Cycle and which has to enter the Monthly Governance Cycle, their respective Feedback and Frozen Periods, and giving much needed clarification for proposals of exactly 50k DAI. This amendment also brings some minor typo fixes to MIP55c1 and MIP55c2.

### Amended MIPs and Components

- Paragraph Summary
   - Clarified amount of Dai needed for MIP55c3 subproposals to enter the Weekly/Monthly Cycle. This was done by specifically clarifying that SPF requests for 50k or less may go into the Weekly Cycle, and requests for more than 50k must go through the Monthly Governance Cycle (providing the feedback period has been fullfilled).
