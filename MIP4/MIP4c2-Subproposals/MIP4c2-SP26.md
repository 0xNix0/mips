## Specification

### Motivation

The long RFC period for Facilitator offboardings creates uncertainty for the DAO, the Facilitator, and DAO partners. It can also hold up valuable work if the Facilitator in question is not fulfilling his mandate.

A Facilitator who should be offboarded should be offboarded quickly. A Facilitator who should not be offboarded benefits from having the proposal resolved quickly. If there is uncertainty, proposers always have the option of using more than the minimum time period.

## Amended Components

[MIP41c5](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP41#MIP41c5)

## Changes

> The proposal parameters are:
>
> * Minimum feedback period: 1 month
> * Minimum frozen period: 1 week

is altered to read:

> The proposal parameters are:
>
> * Minimum feedback period: 2 weeks
> * Minimum frozen period: 1 week
> * Duration of poll: 1 week
>
> MIP41c5 subproposals are eligible to move on-chain on the first Monday after their feedback period has concluded.

This change only applies to a Facilitator offboarding (MIP41c5). It does not apply to the [MIP39c3: Core Unit Offboarding Process](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39#MIP39c3).
