## Specification

### Motivation

MIP50 was too specific to lending protocols. I've updated it for the V2 rewrite which covers all external protocols that allow users to `deposit` / `withdraw` DAI. I've updated the MIP to remove details of the targeting mechanism as that is no longer important.

### Amended MIPs and Components

This MIP4c2 subproposal revises [MIP50](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP50).
