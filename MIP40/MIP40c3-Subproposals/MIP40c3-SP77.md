## Sentence Summary

MIP40c3-SP77 removes all and any active budgets for the Immunefi Core Unit—Dai or MKR.

## Specification

### Motivation

The functions of IS-001 do not require a Core Unit, and should be reduced to contracted services by Core Units that wish to retain Immunefi (the company). This is expected to result in more than 12,000 DAI a month in personnel cost savings alone.

And so this Core Unit should be granted severance and offboarded.

This is part of the list of reforms I laid out [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/decentralized-voter-committees-wednesday-and-thursday-9pm-cest-getting-real-edition/15777/38?u=ippy) for @rune and plan to pursue.

## Core Unit ID

IS-001

### Budget Implementation

On this proposal’s approval:

No more Dai will be transferred for the use of this Core Unit, either through streaming or through direct payments.

### Golden Parachute

Immunefi CU or the community should suggest an appropriate severance for the two contributors.
