## Sentence Summary

This Budget Proposal for DAI expenses aims to fund the activities of the DAI Foundation Core Unit (DAIF-001) as described in [MIP39c2-SP17 adds Core Unit DAIF-001: Dai Foundation](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP17).

## Paragraph Summary

This Budget Proposal for DAI expenses aims to fund the activities of the DAI Foundation Core Unit (DAIF-001) as described in [MIP39c2-SP17 adds Core Unit DAIF-001: Dai Foundation](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP17). This budget is necessary to fund DAIF-001 activities in its second budget year

## Specification

### Motivation

Planning for the best case scenario for MakerDAO requires establishing measures to protect Maker’s intangible assets and preparing to mitigate problems in worst case scenarios:

* What if somebody launches a coin on some other blockchain and calls it Dai?
* What if somebody uses the software developed for the Maker Protocol for purposes that go against the principles of MakerDAO?
* What if there is a governance attack and the attackers get control over the Maker and Dai trademarks?

The independent legal entity Dai Foundation has been created to safeguard what cannot be decentralized in MakerDAO, such as ownership of trademarks, domains, software copyrights, etc., which is connected to a real-world centralized governance body.

Dai Foundation cannot seek profits and [is only mandated to serve its specific purpose](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14S-VIKsLtWq9xdVguaIZgNqtXcTkO3Bq/view): to safeguard the Maker Assets. The Dai Foundation is making these assets available for use by the community to support the sustainability and growth of the Maker Protocol with as few barriers as possible.

The DAI Foundation Core Unit (DAIF-001) is the vehicle that enables the practical implementation of these critical goals.

### Core Unit ID

DAIF-001

### List of Budget Implementations

#### Base Budget Implementation

The DAIF-001 budget includes operational costs and buildup of reserves.

The budget starts September 1st, 2022 but can only be approved in time for the first payments to start October 1st, 2022.

We therefore suggest three budget streams:

* First operational payout in the budget year:
    * A total of **76,561 DAI** will be streamed to 0x34D8d61050Ef9D2B48Ab00e6dc8A8CA6581c5d63 starting 2022-10-1 and ending 2022-10-31.
* Operational payout for the remainder of the year:
    * A total of **376,796 DAI** will be streamed to 0x34D8d61050Ef9D2B48Ab00e6dc8A8CA6581c5d63 starting 2022-11-1 and ending 2023-08-31.
* Payout to build up reserves in the last three months of 2022:
    * A total of **270,000 DAI** will be streamed to 0x5F5c328732c9E52DfCb81067b8bA56459b33921f starting 2022-10-1 and ending 2022-12-31.

#### Some Background

* DAIF-001 will use the [budget reporting template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dyrRelt5X5kD8CyRd6inyKXZV9PwF4RExPLgK3PQIRE/edit#gid=623889111) from the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001), and expect to start reporting into the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling (SES-001) Budget Tool once we have closed the books for June 2022.
* Below we illustrate the implementation for the base case. Here  the payment stream from the first budget year is included for context with the amounts striked out. On the next figure we show payments streams with base case, bear, and super bear side by side for the coming year.
* The current first year's budget is expected to be fully spent. This is due to extraordinary expense we expect to pay in July 2022.
* The Reserves Buildup transfer for this budget proposal is split over two installments to enable a more gradual buildup, but both are executed in 2022 to ensure they are included in the annual reporting for 2022 which Dai Foundation is required to do in Denmark.
* The monthly amounts are averaged to a large degree to facilitate implementation.
* The payment stream in the first budget year for the first month included the payment for the second and third month. Thus the first years payment stream included payment for 14 months.
* The first two months of the budget are received in the first budget year's payment stream (2 x $38,599). Depending on which budget is accepted, these two months will either have a shortfall or a surplus. The first payout in the new stream takes this shortfall/surplus into consideration.
* The two last months in the payment stream builds buffer for the operations of next budget year; they have been set to be the same amount as in the last month of this budget year.
* The payment stream for this budget year includes payment for 12 months.
* The approval of this budget proposal cannot be implemented in an executive vote until some time in September 2022. This first payment is thus set for October 2022 and it will include payment for the first and second month.

The Bear and Super Bear scenario adjustments are explained further down.

#### Bear Scenario Budget Implementation

For the Bear scenario we suggest the following three budget stream:

* First operational payout in the budget year:
    * A total of **67,863 DAI** will be streamed to 0x34D8d61050Ef9D2B48Ab00e6dc8A8CA6581c5d63 starting 2022-10-1 and ending 2022-10-31.
* Operational payout for the remainder of the year:
    * A total of **329,192 DAI** will be streamed to 0x34D8d61050Ef9D2B48Ab00e6dc8A8CA6581c5d63 starting 2022-11-1 and ending 2023-08-31.
* Payout to build up reserves in the last three months of 2022:
    * A total of **270,000 DAI** will be streamed to 0x5F5c328732c9E52DfCb81067b8bA56459b33921f starting 2022-10-1 and ending 2022-12-31.

#### Super Bear Scenario Budget Implementation

For the Super Bear scenario we suggest the following two budget stream:

* First operational payout in the budget year:
    * A total of 39,325 DAI will be streamed to 0x34D8d61050Ef9D2B48Ab00e6dc8A8CA6581c5d63 starting 2022-10-1 and ending 2022-10-31.
* Operational payout for the remainder of the year:
    * A total of 286,363 DAI will be streamed to 0x34D8d61050Ef9D2B48Ab00e6dc8A8CA6581c5d63 starting 2022-11-1 and ending 2023-08-31.

#### Budget Term

The DAIF-001 Budget will begin on September 1st, 2022 and run for 12 months through to August 31st, 2023.

### A Note about the Reserves Buildup

The Dai Foundation is set up to operate in perpetuity. To ensure this isn’t endangered by any individual event, it is important for Dai Foundation to have a “war chest” to cover extraordinary expenses or temporary issues with funding of day-to-day operations.

Examples of events for which Dai Foundation may need access to reserves to continue operation:

* Regulatory or other action which means the contributions from the Protocol to cover daily operations are cut off for a period that may last up to three years
* A lawsuit like the one that was seen after the “Black Thursday” event in 2020. At that time, Dai Foundation was hit with a class action lawsuit. As an entity safeguarding Maker’s intangible assets, Dai Foundation will be the main or rather the only centralized entity to target. Defending against lawsuits can be very expensive --- an estimate of legal cost of $1M in connection with a big US lawsuit is not unrealistic.
* Events where Directors and Officer Insurance is required --- e.g., a lawsuit where board members are sued individually. It is very expensive for Dai Foundation to acquire a Directors and Officers insurance, so as a backup there should be sufficient reserves for Dai Foundation to provide the same cover for its board members as is available to board members in similar foundations, e.g., a coverage up to $2M.

Based on the above, Dai Foundation is aiming to build up reserves of at least $3M, where the protocol donated $2M to reserves the first year. The buildup of the remaining $1M has been split out over four years where the amount this year is $270,000 Dai.

### Increasing Value to Maker Tokenholders

Dai Foundation ensures that the Maker trademarks cannot come under control of a malicious party in case of a governance attack.

Scammers and impersonators reduce the trust and value of the Maker brand. Dai Foundation ensures there is clarity around and enforcement of the Maker trademarks, thereby helping protect Maker tokenholders from lower value due loss of trust in the Maker brand.

DAIF-001 is an enabler that helps other Core Units and actors achieve their MakerDAO objectives.

DAIF-001 enables growth initiatives by making required intangible assets available to those initiatives with as little friction as possible while ensuring those assets remain under Maker Governance control.

As new assets are created we provide guidance and tools to make it easy for contributors to hand over copyrights and other IP rights for the assets to Dai Foundation so these assets become public goods for all of MakerDAO.

### Roadmap and Objectives

The Core Unit mandate describes the responsibilities of DAIF-001 and the associated objectives.

The budget requested is for **ongoing activities** in the areas of:

* Make existing assets available to the community with as little friction as possible, and keep the [Asset Registry](https://github.com/makerdao/asset-registry) up to date.
* Ensure new assets becomes public goods for the DAO.
* Protect the trademarks and act against scammer and infringers.
* Increase transparency.
* Follow Maker Governance discussions in order to always have sufficient context in case a crisis appears which might be a governance attack.

#### Planned Near-term Activities

* Solicit applications from prospective Maker Governance appointed board members and work with GovAlpha on the process for Maker Governance selection/approval of candidates.
* Publish guidelines and tools for ensuring MakerDAO funded software has its copyright assigned to Dai Foundation.
* Ask questions to Core Units to provide better transparency of the IP status of their assets.
* Issue call for grant applications to describe and discuss the relationship between DAOs, their intangible assets, and intellectual property.
* Enable Core Units to host their own email providers on the  *.makerdao.com or *.makerdao.network subdomains
* Collaborate closely with the incubating Brand Core Unit about how to re-activate the MakerDAO website and blog (pending approval of budget for the Brand Core Unit).
* Establish clear channels for reporting scammers and infringers and a status page to see whether a site already has been reported and what the progress is in closing those down.
* Define and document necessary asset management processes in the DAO and automate them as much as possible in order to reduce friction and expensive manual handling.

|Headcount Planning / Team Summary| | |
|:----|:----|:----|
|**Month**|**FTEs**|**Forecasted Total HC Expense**|
|Sep-2022|0.8|15,900|
|Oct-2022|0.8|35,673|
|Nov-2022|0.8|15,900|
|Dec-2022|0.9|21,655|

|Jun-2023|1.0|19,500|
|Jul-2023|1.0|19,500|
|Aug-2023|1.0|23,455|

Note: The above headcount numbers are spread out over one part time facilitator and a board consisting of 5-7 members. In the Bear scenario we will be 0.8 FTE first 6 months and then 0.9 FTE. For the Super Bear scenario the FTE number will be 0.8 for the full period.

* **Bear Case:** Our base budget is already taking the Bear market into account. We are aiming only to spend what is necessary to fulfill our mandate with a view of being able to do this in perpetuity. \
That said, our operational budget could function with 10% less runway for a limited period. In this eventuality, we will scale the amount of travel back, not do any website/educational development, and only onboard one Maker Governance appointed board member. When including reserves, this is a 6.5% reduction compared to the base budget.
* **Super Bear Case:** Our Super Bear scenario. The bare minimum for fulfilling our mandate during a limited period of time could theoretically be done with an operational budget 24% smaller than the base case. Here we would defer having more members join the board. Travel would be scaled down to an absolute minimum. We would only act to shut down scamming sites and to pursue trademark infringements as our reduced bandwidth would allow. Core Units and other Content Managers of MakerDAO intangible assets (subdomains, emails, SoMe channels, etc.) would be asked to cover the expenses (techops and admin) related to configuring and documenting the status of the assets they manage (which really just kicks the can down the road). \
When including reserves, we would postpone requesting reserves buildup for the budget period, which yields up to a 52% reduction compared to the base case.
* In a Bull scenario we anticipate more activity around utilizing and harvesting MakerDAO intangible assets plus more legal IP questions, which would require additional spending on TechOps, Facilitator, and legal services. We have not quantified this, but will return with a subproposal if the Bull market returns in this budget period and more services are needed to avoid hampering the growth of other MakerDAO initiatives.

### Unwinding and Defunding

Dai Foundation is bound by its [mandate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14S-VIKsLtWq9xdVguaIZgNqtXcTkO3Bq/view?usp=sharing) and set to operate in perpetuity. We have thus no unwinding scenario. Should Maker Governance decide not to fund DAIF-001, then Dai Foundation will do its best to provide the MakerDAO community with access to its intangible assets based on a blend of the actual users covering the expenses and a limited draw on the reserves until funding issues are resolved.
