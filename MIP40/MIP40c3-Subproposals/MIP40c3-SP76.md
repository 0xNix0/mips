## Sentence Summary

MIP40c3-SP76 removes all and any active budgets for the Strategic Happiness Core Unit- Dai or MKR

## Specification

### Motivation

The functions of SH-001 do not require a Core Unit. The budget is a significant outlier given the high cost and niche function. Burban should be integrated into growth. The Core Unit is an unnecessary expense and currently represents 64k in monthly costs. It is not essential in a bear market.

The approval of this budget, which tripled during the last approval cycle, was contentious before the significant decline in protocol revenue and overall crypto market.

With the current budget and protocol revenue, the protocol does not receive enough value to justify the expense.

This Core Unit should be granted severance and offboarded.

## Core Unit ID

SH-001

### Budget Implementation

On this proposalâ€™s approval:

No more Dai will be transferred for the use of this Core Unit, either through streaming or through direct payments.

### Golden Parachute

Strategic Happiness or the community should suggest an appropriate severance for the contributors.
