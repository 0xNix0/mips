## Sentence Summary

MIP40c3-SP73 removes all and any active budgets for the Events Core Unit—Dai or MKR.

## Specification

### Motivation

This Core Unit is an unnecessary expense of **$898,150** annually. Events are a "nice to have" and not required for this bear market, particularly considering how Daivinity was executed. Mkr token holders' money was spent on unknown attendees and no business deals or new hires have been credited to that event.

Given current budget constraints, the protocol simply does not accrue value from a core unit whose mission statement is: "To provide the best MakerDAO branded event experience to the crypto & Maker community including industry professionals, influencers, and enthusiasts."

And so this Core Unit should be granted severance and offboarded.

This is part of the list of reforms I laid out [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/decentralized-voter-committees-wednesday-and-thursday-9pm-cest-getting-real-edition/15777/38?u=ippy) for @rune and plan to pursue.

### Core Unit ID

EVENTS-001

### Budget Implementation

On this proposal’s approval:

No more Dai will be transferred for the use of this Core Unit, either through streaming or through direct payments.

### Golden Parachute

|Item|Cost|
|---|---|
|Legal & Accounting|$15,000|
|Saleries and Compensation|$88,336|
|Total|$103,336|
