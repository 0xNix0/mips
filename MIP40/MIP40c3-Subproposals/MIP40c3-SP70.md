## Sentence Summary

MIP40c3-SP70 requests a 12-month budget of 5,085,157.11 DAI for the Growth Core Unit starting from July 2022.

## Paragraph Summary

[TBD]

## Motivation

Growth CU is requesting a 5,085,157.11 DAI budget allocation to deliver its mandate over the next 12 months (i.e., from July 2022 to June 2023). This budget will support the Growth team (i.e., initiatives to develop the MakerDAO ecosystem with new and existing partners) and the Brand team (i.e., a new incubated team within Growth CU and a set of tier-one providers to build a solid, reputable, and consistent brand for MakerDAO and engage strongly with the audience).

As we explained in the post “[The Maker Brand Team](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-maker-brand-team/14442)”, we want to incubate the Brand team inside the Growth CU to support team building and process implementations, until the team is ready to become an independent CU.

Since May 2021, we closed 141 integration with partners around the world, we helped with the onboarding process of stETH, MATIC, PSM-GUSD, PSM-USDP, generating more than 673M DAI and about 3.8M DAI in annual fees, and worked with other CUs on the ideation of an institutional product, that allowed us to maintain one-to-one conversations with companies that generated more than 1.2B DAI and about 29M DAI in annual fees.

With both teams, Growth and Brand, we will continue to help the protocol increase the supply and demand of DAI. The expansion of the Growth team will allow us to generate more opportunities inside the multichain ecosystem, bring more partners as collateral, increase the number of whales opening a vault and create more Dai usages. And by having the Brand team, we will be able to build a strong MakerDAO brand and extend its influence in DeFi and beyond. For more details on our focus and objectives for this year, please refer to the [GrowthCU Last year in review post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/growthcu-last-year-in-review-and-high-level-plan-for-next-year/15100).

## Core Unit ID

Growth (GRO-001)

## List of Budget Implementations

As Growth CU expenses are broken down into fixed and variable costs, we suggest two budget streams:

* Fixed monthly expenses of 311,092.16 DAI - constituted of personnel, marketing, and admin expenditures:
    * A total of  3,733,105.87 DAI will be streamed to 0x7800C137A645c07132886539217ce192b9F0528e starting 2022-7-1 and ending 2023-6-30.

* Variable semi-annual expenses of 676,025.62 DAI (totalling 1,352,051.24 DAI) - constituted of partner and travel expenditures:
    * A total of 676,025.62 DAI will be transferred to 0x7800C137A645c07132886539217ce192b9F0528e on 2022-7-1 (or as soon as the following executive allows).
    * A total of 676,025.62 DAI will be transferred to 0x7800C137A645c07132886539217ce192b9F0528e on 2023-1-1 (or as soon as the following executive allows).

For details on the actual budget, please refer to the [GrowthCU Last Year in Review post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/growthcu-last-year-in-review-and-high-level-plan-for-next-year/15100).

### New Budget Details

The current budget considers actuals from July 2021 to April 2022 and forecasts May and June 2022. As the estimates may be incorrect, any funds remaining in the Growth multisig in June 2022 will be returned to the protocol in the first month of our new term (i.e., July 2022).

Below you will find further details on the above cost items.

#### Personnel Expenses (48% of total budget)

This item includes personnel fees for the Growth and Brand teams and bonuses for the BDs.

The size of the Growth CU team increased from 5.5 FTE in June 2021 to 9.75 FTE in April 2022, and is expected to reach 15.75 FTE by August 2022 (10.25 FTE for Growth and 5.5 FTE for Brand):

* Growth team (from 7.25 to 10.25 FTE) - we plan to add three full-time members to the BD team to strengthen our efforts in high potential regions and accelerate our progress across our key initiatives. Besides the base pay, BDs benefit from a bonus pay scheme, a proactive process that forms goals around the account planning process. The budget for the bonus is therefore increased with the expected new hires.

* Brand team (from 2.5 to 5.5 FTE): the Brand team will build a team of experienced members in Branding and Product Marketing (cf. [The Maker Brand Team](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-maker-brand-team/14442) post for more details).

#### Partner Expenses (16% of total budget)

* Marketing activations: Budget to execute collaboration with Maker partners, including marketing campaigns, educational content, or grants to help partners build products. This also includes small events with partners during conferences.
* Loans: In some cases, depending on the relevance of the partnership, we use 0% loans to help our partners bootstrap their Maker integration.

#### Marketing Expenses (27% of total budget)

**Growth team:**
* The Marketing expenses budget line is to cover sponsorships for certain relevant events such as Hack Money and Mainnet, and media outlets such as Bankless.

**Brand team:**
* Hire Tier-1 global agencies specialized in crypto (to reach media outlets in the crypto world) and with mainstream access (for relevant news and RWA success stories). These agencies will help us create and distribute articles, webinars, media appearances, and podcasts.
* We will be using service providers to create written content, images, and videos that will serve as assets to include in the communications through different channels, including Twitter.

#### Travel Expenses (4% of total budget)

* To cover all expenses for travels to events (when relevant) and the offsite. The cost per FTE is expected at $12.397.

#### Admin Expenses (5% of total budget)

* **Fees:** This covers gas and OTC fees.
* **Professional Services:** Currently, we are working with two legal firms and one accounting agency. The budget increase is for additional hours to work on legal agreements with partners. This year, we want to establish a process where a legal contract accompanies commitments with any Tier-1 partner. It also increased because of the work with branding agencies that will support the Brand team.
* **Software Expenses:** To cover the usage of GSuite, Notion, Zendesk, Docusign, and Nansen.

#### Buffer

* The buffer will help us support any contingency that may occur during the year. The existing buffer holds $350k, and we are not seeking to extend this balance. It will continue as it is.

### Contingency Planning - Scenarios

* **Bear/Superbear:** If the DAO seeks to cut expenses in a bear or superbear market, GrowthCU will reduce expenses for non-business-critical activities: e.g., travel, sponsorships, and marketing activations.

* **Bull:** In a bull market, we would increase our Branding efforts by sponsoring more mainstream events and Maker’s appearance in the media.

### Unwinding and Defunding

If Growth CU is defunded, all current work will be halted to focus on wrapping up existing initiatives, creating documentation of existing processes, transitioning all Maker assets, archiving all information about partners, and the rescission of any active activity contract we may have. Any funds not already allocated (such as personnel fees and active agreements) at offboarding will be returned to the DAO through DSSBlow. We may need to use the buffer to cancel the active contracts and the unwinding of the company. All unvested MKR would be returned to the DAO as of the end date.
