## MIP108c1: Preamble

The Growth Scope Framework covers marketing, public relations, education, and awareness campaigns.

## MIP108c2: Scope Framework Articles

### 1: The Accessibility Advisory Council

#### 1.1: The Accessibility Advisory Council definition
The Accessibility Advisory Council is a group of Ecosystem Actors that have been approved by Maker Governance to carry out advisory work related to improving the content of the Growth Scope Framework and the Interface Scope Framework.

#### 1.2: Accessibility Advisory Council membership management
Members of the Advisory Council are directly approved by Maker Governance through a governance poll, and must fulfill specific criteria.
##### 1.2.1: The Growth Facilitators and Interface Facilitators must ensure that potential Advisory Council Members can apply to be approved by Maker Governance, using an open process with clear instructions.
---
##### 1.2.2: Advisory Council Members must be Ecosystem Actors that are not involved in any business activity that could result in a conflict of interest, either directly or indirectly. They must also have relevant skills for providing professional expert input on the content that the Growth Scope is covering.
---
##### 1.2.3: The Growth Facilitators and Interface Facilitators must periodically, when it is relevant, review the Advisory Council Applications, and if they find applications that are suitable, bring them to a vote through an MKR governance poll. During normal conditions this should be done using the Quarterly Governance Cycle, but in special circumstances can be done through the Weekly Governance Cycle. Approved Advisory Council Members are added to **10.2.3.1:**.
---
##### 1.2.4: The Growth Facilitators and Interface Facilitators may, if they deem it necessary, hold a vote to remove an Advisory Council Member. If an Advisory Council Member has not done any paid work for the Scope for at least 1 year, then the Growth Facilitators and Interface Facilitators can choose to remove them at will, if they deem it necessary.
---
##### 1.2.5: The current approved Advisory Council Members are recorded in *1.2.5.1A*.
###### 1.2.5.1A:

¤¤¤

Current list of Advisory Council Members:
  * N/A

¤¤¤

#### 1.3: Accessibility Advisory Council projects and funding
The Advisory Council is paid on a project basis to do specific work that improves all or specific parts of the Scope Framework.
##### 1.3.1: Each Quarter, if they deem it necessary, the Growth Facilitators and Interface Facilitators must solicit proposals and find one or more suitable Advisory Council Members to perform a project that will result in output that can be used to improve the Scope Framework. This work output will be presented to the CVC Subcommittee Meetings as the starting point for the CVC Scope Framework Position Documents. As many CVCs as possible should be supported this way, prioritized by the Growth Facilitators and Interface Facilitators.
---
##### 1.3.2: In case an ambiguous, uncertain or challenging situation arises related to the Scope Framework, the Responsible Facilitator may approach one or more Advisory Council Members to perform a reactive project that aims to specify the language of the Scope Framework to take into account the specific situation. The Responsible Facilitator can then directly propose the change to the Scope Framework in a weekly governance poll, quickly resolving the challenge.
---
##### 1.3.3: The Advisory Council may not produce work output that is directly compatible with the formatting of the Scope Framework. In this case the Responsible Facilitator must either transcribe it themselves, or hire an Ecosystem Actor to perform the transcription. This role does not require preapproval by Maker Governance.
---
##### 1.3.4: The Growth Facilitators and Interface Facilitators may also produce advisory input on the content of the Scope Framework themselves, as long as it is focused on improving process and governance content. They are prohibited from providing unilateral input on expert subject matter content.
---
##### 1.3.5: The Growth Facilitators and Interface Facilitators have a budget available to pay for Advisory Council Projects per quarter. All spending must be limited to only what is deemed necessary and with a high probability of producing clearly measurable value, and this must be transparently be accounted for in a forum post at least a week before any transaction occurs.
###### 1.3.5.1:

¤¤¤

The Advisory Council project budget is as follows:

| Quarterly Budget (DAI) | Method of Distribution | Maximum Limit (DAI) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Keg - streamed at a linear rate over 3 months | 0 |

¤¤¤

### 2: The Implementation of the Growth Scope Framework through Software

The Growth Facilitators and Interface Facilitators must in collaboration with the CVC Subcommittees, periodically review possibilities of integrating DAO toolkit innovation into the processes and content of the Scope Framework.

### 3: Maker and Dai rebrand

#### 3.1: Maker and Dai rebrand execution
The Growth Scope and the Growth Core Unit is tasked with hiring Ecosystem Actors to rebrand Dai and Maker, and prepare for a large scale public education push to promote the rebrand and the new features available in Endgame and the Maker Constitution.
##### 3.1.1: The new brand must be a complete overhaul that creates a unified brand identity, rather than split between e.g. dai/MKR. 
---
##### 3.1.2: The new brand must focus on the stablecoin product, and differentiate it based on its role in the AI-powered SubDAO ecosystem, which is enabled by blockchain technology and decentralization. 
###### 3.1.2.1: The rebrand must be used as an opportunity to level set the degree of decentralization possible in a scalable stablecoin, to avoid confusion with fully decentralized, unscalable stablecoins like rai or LUSD that have no exposure to real world assets or advanced governance.
---
##### 3.1.3: The new brand must be developed alongside a new website and domain, and Maker Governance will evaluate adoption of the proposed new brand based on the website. The website must also have a special funnel for users being redirected from MakerDAO.com focused on explaining the rebrand to existing users. If the rebrand is accepted, the IP rights of the website must be transferred to the Dai Foundation, or a similar entity.
---
##### 3.1.4: The new brand must be launched alongside the launch of the Sagittarius Engine, the SubDAOs, the MKR redenomination, and the redenominated MKR farm for Dai holders. All Ecosystem Actors that have signed up for the Accessibility Reward must also comply with the rebrand at the same time to be eligible for their Accessility Reward payout.
###### 3.1.4.1: When the rebrand and associated website have been fully developed, and when the relevant Facilitators have indicated that the features described in *3.1.3* are ready for launch, the Growth Facilitator must publish the relevant materials related to the rebrand, and then trigger a governance poll following the Weekly Governance Cycle to ratify or reject the rebrand. 
* **3.1.4.1.1:** This governance poll will also instantly edit all constitutional documents to modify the words used to be in line with the new brand. No changes to the logic of the constitutinonal documents, other than names and brand related descriptions, are valid. The rewritten constitutional documents must be submitted alongside the other brand materials.
---
##### 3.1.5: The budget available for the rebrand and associated educational campaigns is specified in *3.1.5.1A*. As rebranding a widely used stablecoin is a massive challenge that requires significant messaging up front to avoid confusion, it is important that more than enough resources are applied to prevent any risk that the rebrand will backfire. The rebranding project budget is a one time budget that doesn't renew over time, and payouts from the budget can be triggered by a message in the Maker Core forum specifying the amount to pay out, and the recipient address. The payment is then put to a Governance Poll following the weekly cycle and paid out in a weekly Executive Vote. Every time a payout is done, the remaining budget in *3.1.5.1A* must be reduced to reflect the spent amount.
###### 3.1.5.1A:

¤¤¤

Remaining available budget for the rebrand project:
5 million DAI

¤¤¤

### 4: Accessibility Reward

The Accessibility Reward is a payment that SubDAOs and Ecosystem Actors can receive if they comply with the Accessibility brand guidelines and either hold Dai directly or provide users access to Dai or smart contracts that hold Dai.

#### 4.1: Accessibility Reward signup process

Ecosystem Actors that hold Dai or provide access to Dai can sign up for the Accessibility Reward by posting a message on the Maker Core forum specifying the ethereum address for receiving the Accessibility Reward, and the means to independently, unambiguously track the amount of Dai they hold or provide access to in real time, such as specifying wallets or smart contracts and proving the link to the receiving address. 
##### 4.1.1: The Ecosystem Actors that are actively earning the Accessibility Reward are specified in *4.1.1.1A*. The Growth Facilitators can directly edit the active element at will and must update it when new Ecosystem Actors sign up. If an Ecosystem Actor that is signed up for the Accessibility Reward is found by the Growth Facilitators to not comply with the brand guidelines, they must be immediately removed.
######4.1.1.1A:

¤¤¤

List of Ecosystem Actors signed up for the Accessibility Reward:
N/A

#### 4.2: Pre-rebrand Accessibility Reward specifications
Before the rebrand and 3 months after the rebrand, the Accessibility Reward has special parameters that vary based on how the Dai is held. The Pre-rebrand Accessibility Reward is only paid out after the rebrand is successful.
##### 4.2.1: The terms of the two variations of the Pre-rebrand Accessibility Reward are specified in the following subelements. These terms only apply to Ecosystem Actors that fully comply with the brand guidelines until the end of the Pre-rebrand period 3 months after the rebrand is executed. The exact amount is calculated after the fact by calculating average values held per day since the moment the Ecosystem Actor signs up for the Pre-rebrand Accessibility Reward.
###### 4.2.1.1: For Dai that is not earning DSR the rate is 3% per year for the Ecosystem Actor.
###### 4.2.1.2: For Dai that is actively earning DSR or farming SubDAO tokens the rate is 1% per year for the Ecosystem Actor.
###### 4.2.1.3: During the month of May 2023, the Growth Facilitators may propose a one-time modification of both of the Pre-rebrand Accessibility Reward values specified in *4.2.1.1* and *4.2.1.2* by posting a message to the Maker Core forum specifying the new values to trigger a Governance Poll following the Weekly Governance Cycle. If it is accepted, the relevant values are edited accordingly.
---
##### 4.1.3: The Pre-rebrand Accessibility Reward is accrued from the moment the Ecosystem Actor signs up based on the process in *4.1*. The accrued amount is calculated offchain by Ecosystem Actors working on behalf of the Growth Facilitators, and it is paid out through individual Governance Polls that are accompanied by the relevant data for calculating the accrued amount, as well as a review of the receipients adherence to the brand guidelines, ensuring Maker Governance gets one last check that the numbers are correct and that the Ecosystem Actor did support in the rebrand.

#### 4.3: Accessibility Reward Specification
Following the Pre-rebrand phase, the Accessibility reward will normalize to a long term value that depends on whether the recipient is an Ecosystem Actor or a SubDAO. There is no distinction between Dai that is or isn't earning DSR or SubDAO tokens.
##### 4.3.1: Ecosystem Actors earn an Accessibility Reward equivalent to 0.15% per year of the Dai they hold or provide access to while following the required brand guidelines.
---
##### 4.3.2: SubDAOs earn an Accessibility Reward equivalent to 0.2% per year of the Dai they hold or provide access to while followingn the required brand guidelines. This does not apply to Dai held in Elixir.
---
##### 4.3.3: The Accessibility Reward payouts are bundled into a weekly executive vote at the end of every quarter, after review by the Accessibility CVC Subcommittees.

### 5: Accessibility communication channels

Maker must maintain various communication channels to help with access and interaction of the Maker Ecosystem. These communication channels are distinct from the governance focused communication channels.

#### 5.1: Accessibility chat
The Accessibility chat is a chat platform that allows Maker and SubDAO community members to chat and interact, teaching newcomers about the system or discussing various technical details. It must be maintained as an external facing platform with tight moderation that preserves it as a friendly and safe space for interested outsiders, new and old users, community regulars, and ecosystem participants and businesses. To prevent the risk of exposing outsiders to politics, drama and toxic behaviour, governance debate or emotional governance related statements must not be allowed, and would-be debaters must be referred to the CVC communication channels, or if necessary dealt with through moderation. "ELI5" governance discussion and communication related to onboarding into governance, CVCs and similar are considered relevant for accessibility and should be allowed.

#### 5.2: Accessibility on external platforms
MakerDAO must support the accessibility of the Maker Ecosystem by paying Ecosystem Actors to maintain accounts and channels on external platforms, such as Twitter and Telegram. These accounts may develop and share accessibility content that follows the brand guidelines.

#### 5.3: Accessibility communication channel budget
The Accessibility communication channel budget is used to maintain the tasks described in this Article.
##### 5.3.1: The Accessibility communcation channel budget is specified in *5.3.1.1A*. It is a monthly recurring budget accessed through a keg. The Growth Facilitator can propose to modify the budget by posting a message in the Maker Core forum specifying the proposed new value, which triggers a Governance Poll in the Weekly Governance Cycle, that edits the value if it is accepted.
###### 5.3.1.1A:

¤¤¤

The Accessibility communication channel budget is:
0 Dai per per month, implemented with dssvest.
