## Specification  

### Motivation
MIP1 was largely forgotten and never managed to serve its purpose, but with the Endgame Plan, the same core concept is revived as there needs to be clarity around precisely when Maker Governance starts to slow down and not invite so many proposals.

### Problem Space Changes
This Subproposal removes the following items from the Problem Space:
- Core Governance Framework
- Collateral Onboarding
- Decentralized Oracle Freeze Module
- Appeals Process
- Dai Stabilization Cycle
- Vote Delegation
- Synthetic Assets
- Oracles
- Emergency Oracles
- Dai Stability Adjustment Module
- Website and Social Media
- Guardian Entities and Reserves
- Vote Incentives
- Revisit Auction Design
- Dai Foundation
- It also deletes the "important note" to reduce clutter and confusion. This results in the deletion of all content between lines 82 and 103.

It adds the following items to the Problem Space, inserting them at line 82:

1. **Constitution:** The constitution is a MIP that contains the core tenets of the social contract and voter pre-agreements that stabilize the meta of the Endgame State
2. **Endgame Product MIPs:** A set of MIPs that define each Endgame Product in as much detail as possible. Only products that are already detailed and defined in the Endgame Products MIPs can be added to the Maker Protocol.
3. **Scope MIPs:** The Scope MIPs are individual MIPs that each cover the 11 Scopes that define all Maker Governance processes and the expectations and KPIs of the Decentralized Workforce.
4. **Metanomics:** The Metanomics MIP provides an immutable and unambiguous definition of what the long-run, unchangeable tokenomics of the Endgame State will be. This includes MKR emissions, Maker surplus funnelling, MetaDAO emissions, and MetaDAO surplus funnelling.
5. **Launch MetaDAO Activation:** To trigger the Endgame Plan Launch, a Launch MetaDAO Activation MIP is required, as this authorizes the deployment and activation of the MetaDAO tokens and the MetaDAO token farms.
