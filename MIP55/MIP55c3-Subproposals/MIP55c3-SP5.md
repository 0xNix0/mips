## Sentence Summary

The MakerDAO Interim Chief Legal Officer Special Purpose Fund will pay legal fees and expenses to retain Kianga Daverington, Esq. through @DaveringtonPLLC as full-time Interim Chief Legal Officer of MakerDAO for a period of six months.

## Paragraph Summary

[TBD]

## Motivation

MakerDAO faces a number of challenges and opportunities that require legal review, analysis and expertise across a wide spectrum of areas including governance, operations, product and strategy. 

Being a fully decentralized autonomous organization is MakerDAO’s greatest strength and asset for realizing its full potential in the years ahead. At the same time, the absence of DAO legal personhood frustrates its ability to: (1) to engage counsel on behalf of the DAO as a whole and (2) act directly as a counterparty in real world interactions.

The current state of decentralization at MakerDAO and its distributed governance model via Recognized Delegates lacks adequate legibility and accountability for the risks and responsibilities resting with each natural individual participant and his/her/their organizational affiliation within the DAO.

Efforts underway to redesign or improve governance and incentive alignment throughout the DAO require more than just an economic lens. We require a thorough and robust understanding of the global regulatory landscape both for the protection of participants and for safe-guarding the protocol’s ability to provide its products and services to the world.

ACREinvest believes that in our role as an Independent Delegate we represent the best “proxy” to serve as a client within the framework of an attorney-client relationship. We are in the unique position to have a Founder who is also an attorney admitted to practice law in the State of New York, United States and maintains a separate law practice, [Daverington PLLC](https://www.daverington.com/). 

Kianga Daverington has the flexibility, desire and ability to serve MakerDAO in this expanded capacity for a crucial interim period of heightened market risk while community consensus forms on the longer-term improvements needed in governance structure, tokenomics, strategy and operations.

## Special Purpose Fund Name

***IMPORTANT*: The legal services proposed here are in no way a substitute or alternative to any current requests/proposals for funding legal resources internally or via outside counsel. Rather, the additional provision of Senior Management legal oversight is necessary for the successful coordination of all legal and regulatory issues and services. The need is particularly acute in the short term until MakerDAO can implement its longer-term strategy for workforce management and oversight.**
