## Sentence Summary

This subproposal aims to allocate 90,000 DAI to the Ambassador Program to cover work for the next six months.

## Paragraph Summary

The MakerDAO Ambassador Program currently provides Spanish speaking communities with original resources and educational materials to further decentralize and expand the MakerDAO community. Ambassadors are creating their own original region-oriented content as they keep providing two-way translation services; they also engage their communities with local events (on- and offline), and share content produced in their language with the MakerDAO community.

## Motivation

This Special Purpose Fund aims to finance the ongoing work and projects of the Ambassador Program.

## Special Purpose Fund Name

Ambassador Program Special Purpose Fund.

## Special Purpose Fund Scope & Work Credentials

![](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP55/MIP55c3-Subproposals/supporting_materials/MIP55c3-SP17/ambassador1.png)

In the past months the Ambassador Program has seen some changes. It was after the team's [first SPF](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip55c3-sp7-special-purpose-fund-for-the-ambassador-program/17169) was posted that we received feedback from the community for the very first time since our inception. At the beginning of this 'second stage' of the program ([_after it's 3-month pilot_](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-fund-ambassadors-program-pilot/13199)), we suffered the departure of @kat and it was @sebix who took care of the Ambassadors and their projects.

 As a team, and regarding feedback received from different community members, it was decided to drop weekly translations (such as Weekly Relay and Forum at a Glance) to start creating original region-oriented content to have a greater impact in the regions the program is currently working on. We introduced a brand new [LATAM Newsletter](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/bolet%C3%ADn-de-noticias), which addresses regional crypto-related news and issues as well as global ones. The program also started using Twitter Spaces and created the Meet the Makers series (interviews with different contributors of Makerdao, from Core Unit contributors, to Facilitators and Recognized Delegates) and Coffee Hours (a place to facilitate and strengthen MakerDAO's partnerships with different communities and projects).

 The Program has also been developing a website and an introductory portal entirely made in Spanish for the LATAM Community as a 'first step' to get to know the protocol. Ambassadors also are contributing to the creation of MakerDAO's first LATAM Delegate Platform through educational material, calls and meetups; a very important project that will be a step further in the decentralization of the protocol.

 All these new projects will be further described below and are the basis on which the Ambassador Program will continue to develop relationships with communities, projects, entities and talents in Latin America interested in participating in MakerDAO.

The following statement stays true to the Program's scope and vision:

_"There is a huge amount of potential for MakerDAO in non-English speaking communities and a lack of educational resources as well as means for these community members to participate. The Ambassador Program allows for these communities to engage with MakerDAO—bringing us a new wave of community members, developers, talent, and MKR holders."_

### :book: Evergreen Material Translation

The Ambassadors have and will continue to translate essential parts of the Protocol documentation.
- The translation of the [Maker Operational Manual in Spanish](https://manual.makerdao.com/v/mom-spanish/) was done in a joint effort with GovAlpha and it's updated regularly.
- The Program will also collaborate with GovAlpha to translate future EndGame official documentation for the Protocol.
- Also in coordination with GovAlpha, program aims to make official MIPs translations and reviewing older ones to be incorporated in the MIPs Portal to take advantage of its multi-language support.
- The [MakerDOCs documentation](https://sebix.notion.site/sebix/MakerDOCs-en-Espa-ol-07d9dd32599640ad91ca1431797627e5) has been fully translated and is already available for the whole community.

### 🌎 Website & Introductory Portal

![](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP55/MIP55c3-Subproposals/supporting_materials/MIP55c3-SP17/ambassador2.png)

The program members noticed a lack of introductory material about MakerDAO and a need for it from the spanish-speaking community. It was also noticeable that all information was spread across a large number of forum posts and portals outside the forums, making it difficult to access. After a lot of hard work, an official MakerDAO LATAM website has been made by the Ambassador Program following [Growth's Brand Guidelines](https://www.figma.com/file/ojaWTCDuJcUfYuDMB1hyAg/MakerDAO-Protocol-Health-Page-Brand-Design?node-id=262%3A2852) facilitated by @Nadia and @Tobal. A [MIP60c3 procedure has been recently initiated](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/latam-makerdao-com-subdomain/20041) in order to officially use the MakerDAO name and brand.

The purpose of this website is to gather all original and translated educative content for the hispanic interested parties and community members, thus making it easier to navigate across the material and find information to start learning and participating.

The Ambassador Program has created a new Spanish Introductory Portal, which is all 100% original content made by and for LATAM users. It addresses the following points:

 - Introduction to the DAO
    - What is a DAO
    - Maker History and Maker Foundation
    - DAOs Core Principles
- Maker Governance
    - What is Governance
    - On & Off-Chain Governance
    - Voting & Proposals Cycles
    - How to Participate
- DAI
    - What is DAI
    - DAI uses
    - How to get DAI
- Oracles
    - Utility & Basic Concepts
- Vaults
    - Use Cases & Basic Concepts
    - Stability Fees
    - Risks & Liquidations
- Delegates
    -  Definition, Types and Basic Concepts
    -  Requirements
    -  Code of Conduct
- Glossary
- Writing Style Guide (specially written for spanish speaking people who will be interacting within Maker in both languages)

**Website Update: Web3 Beginners Guide by MakerDAO.**

 Even though there is a lot of online articles that illustrate the basic aspects of the Web3 ecosystem, we believe this is a vital resource that cannot be missing in our introductory documentation. We think assisting newcomers to Web3 in this very first step will help MakerDAO attract a new wave of users and gain a better position in the region. The Ambassador Program is already working on these articles as this will be the first major update for the website. Here's a list of the guide's main points:

- What is Ethereum?
- Web 3
- DeFi, TradFi, CeFi, ReFi
- Blockchain: Basic Concepts
- Gas (Fees)
- Smart Contracts: Basic Concepts
- Token, Tokenomics
- NFTs
- Wallets
- P2P: Basic Concepts
- What is a Dapp?
- What is a Stablecoin?
- DAOs
- Cryptocurrencies: Basic Concepts
- Blockchain Trilemma
- Scalability Solutions
- Layers 1 & 2
- Rollups
- DEXs vs CEXs
- Proof of Stake

_More information about this will be available once the website has been formally presented._

**Website Preview**

 The website is currently in the works and will debut in March, 2023. Once online, the website will be constantly updated as new Spaces, Newsletters and Introductory Portal's articles will continue to be worked on by the Ambassador Program.

- A mockup version of the official website can be found :point_right: [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lAj9WA43X6608itbHPb0Jib45YjmP42C?usp=sharing).
- Also, a pre-alpha browsable version of the website made on Wix can be seen :point_right: [here](https://snhipogeo.wixsite.com/programa-embajador/).

### :newspaper: LATAM Newsletter

![](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP55/MIP55c3-Subproposals/supporting_materials/MIP55c3-SP17/ambassador3.png)

As previously mentioned, the program dropped weekly translations and started working on an original region-oriented newsletter to cause a greater impact on LATAM communities. Results so far have been encouraging. Now in it's fourth edition, the newsletter received a lot attention from outside visitors as result of how Maker news were mixed with regional and international information about the Web3 ecosystem, thus making it appealing to not only MakerDAO members, but to DeFi ecosystem users altogether.

 This is the reason why the newsletter has earned the 'Good Share' badge in the forums and praises from different community members.

Here's a quick access list to the Ambassador Program's newsletters so far:

#### Twitter Spaces

 As mentioned before, the Meet the Makers series and the Coffe Hours are places created to educate and strenghten relationships with the community. The Meet the Makers spaces help the community to get to know the different actors and contributors of the DAO first hand and participate by asking questions about the protocol and their roles. So far, series has hosted calls with Core Unit contributors, facilitators and recognized delegates. The program will also regularly host Coffee Hours in order to create room for collaboration with different LATAM ecosystem talents, communities and projects. Here's a list of the Spaces hosted so far:

 - **Meet the Makers ep. 1**, with Tobal:

**Ethereum Venezuela**

The Ambassador's Program contributed to organizing the [first Ethereum Venezuela meet up](https://twitter.com/ETHVenezuela/status/1597351549663318017?s=20), a local event focused on the most innovative projects built on top of Ethereum. We had the opportunity to share with the audience:

- What is MakerDAO?
- How does the Maker Protocol work?
- How does a Decentralized Governance works?
- What is DAI?
- What can we use DAI for?

Program had the chance to spread the word and show the people why a decentralized stablecoin is a game changer for the region. It was a great time for everyone, as most of the audience didn't even know about Maker nor DAI and got really excited. The talk ended with a question and answer session and a discussion about the implications of these technologies in the economy.

### First LATAM Delegate Platform in MakerDAO

 Ambassadors has been assisting in the creation of the first LATAM delegate platform by hosting calls and meetups, providing educational material in spanish and contacts management to the DeFi LATAM community. We are proud to anounce that the SEED LATAM delegate platform will soon be launched in March, 2023!

- **DeFi LATAM Calls**

![](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP55/MIP55c3-Subproposals/supporting_materials/MIP55c3-SP17/ambassador17.png)

- **Meetup w/ LATAM DeFi members in Palermo, Argentina**

A very extense meetup was recently organized with the DeFi LATAM members to talk about the new LATAM Delegate Platform and protocol's governance.

![](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP55/MIP55c3-Subproposals/supporting_materials/MIP55c3-SP17/ambassador23.png)


<sub>Several members from DeFi LATAM and the Ambassador Program attended to the meetup.</sub>

### LATAM Community Poll & Report

![](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP55/MIP55c3-Subproposals/supporting_materials/MIP55c3-SP17/ambassador18.png)

- <sub>The Ambassador Program presents the first LATAM community poll.</sub>

A research on the LATAM community was started by the program by doing a first poll and analyzing its results. The outcome was a very interesting report that's available in [spanish](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/informe-de-la-1-encuesta-del-programa-embajador/20017) and will soon be posted in english in the MakerDAO Forums for the whole community.

We think that sociological, political and demographic approaches to the MakerDAO community are not only a very interesting tool in order to glimpse the shape and _ethos_ of this ever-evolving community itself, but a necessary one; specially in times of transformations and internal and external challenges, such as the ones we are experiencing.

**Multi-Sig**
- Multi-Sig's ownership change.
    - @Sebix is the new owner of the Ambassador Program's Multi-Sig as per [this procedure](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/change-of-ownership-of-the-ambassador-programs-multi-sig/19087).
- Multi-Sig's comptroller change.
    - At January 31 @DavidUtro stopped being a comptroller for the Ambassador Program's Multi-Sig.
    - @0xdeniz is the new confirmed comptroller replacing of David.

**Expenses**
- A [report sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RWvZVHt1hP6jLBO5SqJy3oPp9pWd1S2iA6u62t7ANlc/edit#gid=0) has been made in order to help community keep a track on the program's expenses.
- The sheet will be regularly updated as new expenses occur.
- Multi-Sig's transaction history can be [seen here](https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=eth%3A0xF411d823a48D18B32e608274Df16a9957fE33E45).

#### Unused Funds

This were unused funds from the program's pilot fund and were returned to the DAO as stated by Kat in [our Signal Request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-fund-ambassadors-program-pilot/13199/14).
- Unused funds from our [previous SPF](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip55c3-sp7-special-purpose-fund-for-the-ambassador-program/17169) will also be returned to the DSS address on May 2023 after the passing of this vote.

---

### Quarterly Reports

The Ambassador Program will begin to post quarterly reports on expenses and projects in order to improve communications and receive more feedback from the community.

---

### Future of the Ambassador Program

In this 'second stage' of the Ambassador Program we thought that, instead of focusing entirely on gaining more views, interactions or participations — things that, they alone, do not represent necessarily quality or adoption nor knowledge of MakerDAO and DAI —, some solid structural base of material was needed. That is why, in the past months, the Program has consolidated the bases on which a larger community could be build. The Spaces, Newsletters, introductory portal and website are all part of a plan that has already been set in motion in order to facilitate participation and involvement in the protocol from different communities and talents. Also, this base is important, because now we have something to offer to those who, for example, do not know much —or even anything— about MakerDAO, as we consider that attracting new people it is central in order to expand DAI around the globe and deepen its decentralization. This offer, as already mentioned, now cover aspects related to education, information, accesibility and channels of possible interaction and articulation between the region and the Protocol; a relation in which the Ambassador Program sees itself as a bridge working both ways. It is from here that, without ceasing to expand, enrich, refine and keep updated all this structure, we can embrace the challenge of stablish ourselves as a node between the spanish-speaking world —plethoric of opportunities and potentiality— and MakerDAO.

The program is currently in talks with different community members, facilitators and delegates regarding it's transition to the EndGame. While we do not rule out having to request funding through MIPs after this 6 months, **our aim is to become an ecosystem actor** in the future to keep contributing to the DAO.

---

### Funding Breakdown

 We are presenting two options for funding. The Ambassador Program is currently covering a lot of ground and is quickly growing and community will be able to vote to support the continuous expansion of the program or keep it running as is.

 First option is the full coverage of the program's objectives: it aims to add two new part-timers for community management and publicity, and takes in consideration all the traveling, website, swag and reward expenses required for current and future projects of the program.

 The second one is the minimum required for the program to maintain current activities and does not contemplate swag; travelling expenses and rewards are kept to a minimum. Only one new part-timer would be hired to recover the lost position.

The following are the summaries of the Ambassadors Program 6-month budget outlining how the funds will be used in each case:  

**Option 1:**
