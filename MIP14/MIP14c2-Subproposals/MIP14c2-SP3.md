## Specification

### Sentence Reason

Currently, information about the Endgame Plan and transition is fragmented and exists in a plethora of forum posts, often with multiple versions and their comments, Discord messages, and Youtube videos of Zoom call recordings.

The proposed funding will finance development of an information portal with good search capabilities and ---ideally--- decentralized storage.

### Reason Details

The funding will be for the winner of a JokeDAO contest to implement the best proposed solution for an Endgame information portal. The reward is 9,999 DAI. The underlying voting tokens have already been distributed to MKR holders, delegates, and CU members for the last [JokeDAO contest](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/using-jokedao-for-soft-consensus-in-governance/17673).

The JokeDAO entrants should submit a proposal containing:

* The title of their proposed solution.
* What the solution would look like (sketches, MVPs, or previous work encouraged).
* How theyâ€™d implement their proposed solution (e.g., technical architecture or no-code platforms).
* A timeframe, milestones if needed, and the due date for delivery.

There are three steps: 
1. Passing this Maker native proposal, 
2. the JokeDAO entry submissions, and 
3. the voting (on JokeDAO). 

If this proposal passes, the solution race will last for two weeks after the ratification of this proposal. Finding a winner during voting will last for one week. The winner will get paid 9,999 DAI to implement the solution.

Payout will be done by the JokeDAO smart contracts via the rewards feature. We propose paying out 1k immediately after the winner is elected and 8,999 DAI after successfully completing the proposal to safeguard funds.

JokeDAO is working with the authors to find a solution to automate these payouts as much as possible.

### DAI Transfer Ceiling Analysis

The proposed transfer is within the parameters of the [Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling (250,000 DAI)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP14#MIP14c4).

### Targets

The recipient is the smart contract for the JokeDAO contest. The address is TBA.
