The Finance Facilitators must in collaboration with the CVC Subcommittees, periodically review possibilities of integrating DAO toolkit innovation into the processes and content of the Scope Framework.

### 3: Project Budgets management

#### 3.1: Project Budgets definition
Project Budgets are elements in the Scope Frameworks that define a budget implementation, giving the Scope Facilitators access to drawing Dai and/or MKR from a keg or another smart contract system, in order to fund projects. The projects that are funded must be chosen to meet a specific objective that is defined in the context of the Project Budget, typically within the same article, and other related articles.
