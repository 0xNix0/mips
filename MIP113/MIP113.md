### MIP113c1: Preamble

The Arbitration Scope covers principles and processes related to high level decision making, constitutional interpretation and regulation of constitutional conservers and regulation the core governance processes. The Arbitration Scope plays a critical rule for governance security, and its processes and rules must be defined to enforce that they are carefully followed with care and precision. The Arbitration Scope constrains and supersedes all other Scope Frameworks.

### MIP113c2: Scope Framework Articles

#### 1: Constitutional Interpretation

##### 1.1: Constitutional Interpretation definition
Constitutional Interpretation is used to disambiguate elements in the constitution with expanded definitions, in connection with specific decisions or disputes relying on language from the Maker Constitution. To make the Maker Constitution as solid and immutable as possible, all constitutional interpretation is recorded to set a precedent about the spirit of the constitution and how future interpretations should be made.

##### 1.2: Principles of using Constitutional Interpretation
Constitutional Interpretation should only be employed when the Maker Constitution itself does not offer enough clarity or contains faults or omissions that can be mitigated by extrapolating the spirit of the Contitution. The resolution of constitutional ambiguity or disputes must be fully congruent with the spirit of the Constitution and prior precedent, while also clearly setting new precedent and help to prevent future ambiguous situations from occuring. Depending on the level of ambiguity, an MKR vote may be needed to establish the precedent.

##### 1.3 Constitutional Intepretation Process
This section contains the processes for proposing and settling Constitutional Interpretations.
* **1.2.1:** Constitutional interpretation precedent approved through MKR vote is contained as subelements of this clause. A majority of Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope can trigger a vote to add a new subelement if it is necessary resolve a constitutional ambiguity.
---
* **1.2.2:** Constitutional Interpretation precedent made directly by the Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope is contained as Active Subelements to the Active Element *1.2.2.1A*.
	* **1.2.2.1A:**

    List of Constitutional Interpretations:
      * N/A

    ¤¤¤

#### 2: Scope Framework appeals

##### 2.1: Scope Framework appeals definition
Scope Framework appeals are a process that allows any Maker Governance participant to trigger a review of a Scope Framework. This can be in connection with the Scope Framework failing to follow the Constitutional Boundaries, or if it contains biased or otherwise conflicted elements. It can either be a general misalignment of the language of the Scope Framework, or a specific situation where the Scope Framework is being misinterpreted or otherwise violated. 

##### 2.2: Scope Framework appeals process
Scope Framework appeal proposals are submitted by CVC Members, and can be accepted or rejected by a majority of the Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope. If a Scope Framework appeal is accepted, the Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope must review it. Arbitration Facilitators can also directly choose to review a Scope Framework for adherence with constitutional requirements.
* **2.2.1:** The Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope can by consensus directly edit a Scope Framework to align its content with the constitutional boundaries and other constitutional requirements such as neutrality.
---
* **2.2.2:** A majority of the Responsible Facilitators can trigger an MKR governance poll to implement an edit to the appealed Scope Framework that will align it with the constitutional boundaries and other constitutional requirements such as neutrality.

#### 3: Constitutional Conserver management

##### 3.1: Constitutional Conserver management definition
Constitutional Conservers are Ecosystem Actors that perform specific critical tasks in Maker Governance. The Arbitration Scope is tasked with monitoring their adherence to the constitutional rules that apply to them, and take action when necessary.

##### 3.2: Constitutional Conserver recognition
Constitutional Conservers must be recognized by the Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope. The process of obtaining recognition is specific to each type of Constitutional Conserver. It is not possible for a Constitutional Conserver to gain recognition in more than one type of role at the same time, attempting to become recognized as a different Constitutional Conserver will mean reliquinshing the old Constitutional Conserver recognition.

##### 3.3: Constitutional Conserver adherence requirements
Constitutional Conservers must support the integrity of the Maker Constitution. This includes following specific requirements, as well as indirect requirements extraprolated from the spirit of the constitution.
* **3.3.1:** Constitutional Conservers may not incite actions that contradict the Maker Constitution.
---
* **3.3.2:** Constitutional Conservers may not incite attempts to modify or overturn the Maker Constitution outside of its self-contained processes.

##### 3.3: Constitutional Conserver derecognition process
The Responsible Facilitators of the Arbitration Scope must derecognize Constitutional Conservers that break the Constitutional Conserver adherence requirements specified in *3.3*.
* **3.3.1:** Derecognition of an Ecosystem Actor identity can be done by a Responsible Facilitator of the Arbitration Scope, by directly adding them to the Active Element *3.3.1.1A*.
	* **3.3.1.1A:**

    ¤¤¤

    List of derecognized Ecosystem Actors:
      * N/A

    ¤¤¤

---
* **3.3.2:** If a Constitutional Conserver breaks the adherence requirements, but the Responsible Facilitators fail to derecognize them, any MKR holder can lock 10 MKR, by sending it to the Pause Proxy, to trigger a vote of derecognition. This process is to be replaced by the Facilitator penalty mechanism.
	* **3.3.2.1:** If the derecognition vote succeeds, the Constitutional Conserver is derecognized, and the 10 MKR is returned to the MKR holder that triggered the vote.
	* **3.3.2.2:** If the derecognition vote fails, in case there were legitimate concerns about the constitutional adherence of a Constitutional Conserver, a Responsible Facilitator may bundle an executive vote payload to return the 10 MKR to the MKR holder that triggered the vote.

#### 4: Constitutional Voter Committee Management

##### 4.1: Constitutional Voter Committee Definition
Constitutional Voter Committees are organized groups of Ecosystem Actors with publicly verified MKR ownership. Their role is to represent the interests of MKR holders and form opinions on the direction of Maker Governance, primarily through the modification of the Scope Frameworks in quarterly cycles.

##### 4.2: Constitutional Voter Committee Member recognition process
* **4.2.1:** To become recognized as an Unaffiliated CVC Member, an Ecosystem Actor must post a recognition submission message publicly on the Maker Governance Forum.
    * **4.2.1.1:** A recognition submission message must be cryptographically signed by an Ethereum address that controls at least 0.001 MKR. The MKR can be any combination of MKR held in the wallet, deposited into the Chief, or delegated to a Protocol Delegation Smart Contract.

	* **4.2.1.3:** The amount of MKR controlled by the CVC member's address as defined in *4.2.1.1* will become the CVC Member's *Verified MKR Holding*.
	  * **4.2.1.3.1:** A CVC Member may opt to use an MKR amount as their *Verified MKR Holding* that is less than the amount of MKR controlled by their address as defined in *4.2.1.1*. This should be clearly indicated when they post their recognition submission message.
	  * **4.2.1.3.2:** A CVC Member's *Verified MKR Holding* will be used as their vote-weight in internal CVC Decision votes, even if their address accumulates more MKR.
	  * **4.2.1.3.3:** If the the amount of MKR controlled by the CVC member's address as defined in *4.2.1.1* drops below their *Verified MKR Holding*, they are automatically offboarded from the CVC, until a vote to onboard them again takes place.
	  * **4.2.1.3.4:** A CVC Member that is already a member of a CVC can apply to update their *Verified MKR Holding* through the CVC Decision process, see *4.5.4.8*.
	  * **4.2.1.3.5:** Unaffiliated CVC Members may update their *Verified MKR Holding* at any time by submitting a signed message underneath their initial CVC Member Recognition Message. When an Unaffiliated CVC Member applies to join a CVC, their *Verified MKR Holding* is frozen until their application is rejected, or a future CVC Decision is taken to update their *Verified MKR Holding*.
    * **4.2.1.4:** A recognition submission message must use the format described in *4.2.1.5*.

#### 7: Pregame bootstrapping

##### 7.1: Pregame bootstrapping votes
Arbitration Facilitators are empowered to use broad judgement when exercising their ability to make direct constitutional interpretations and edits to the Maker Constitution and the Scope Frameworks in *1* and *2*, when this relates to unintended consequences or mistakes in the affected documents.
* **7.1.1:** In case of unintended consequences or mistakes in the Maker Constitution and Scope Frameworks causing Maker Governance to function incorrectly, the Arbitration Facilitators can at any time run a Governance Poll to enable MKR holders to make a decision that will alleviate and resolve unintended consequences or mistakes.
* **7.1.2:** The Arbitration Facilitators can at any time propose to edit any content of a Scope Framework through a Governance Poll.

### MIP113c3: Responsible Facilitators

The Responsible Facilitators of each Scope Framework are responsible for adhering to the contents of the relevant Scope Framework elements.

The Responsible Facilitators also have the governance privilege to interpret, trigger or use any of the processes described in the Scope Framework elements.

During the Pregame, the Responsible Facilitators are defined as the Core Unit Facilitators of the Core Units that are listed as Responsible Facilitator Core Units.

The Responsible Facilitator Core Units for each Scope are defined in MIP113c2.6.1.2.1A.

### MIP113c4: Active Responsible Facilitator Core Unit List Modification Subproposal Process

This component is a subproposal process component that, if approved by Maker Governance, modifies the state of MIP113c2.6.1.2.1A to update the list of Responsible Facilitators.

Subproposals must use the [Active Responsible Facilitator Core Unit List Modification Template](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP113/MIP113c4-Subproposal-Template.md).

This component can be used to add, amend, or remove Responsible Facilitator Core Units from any of the approved Scope Frameworks.

MIP113c4 subproposals have the following parameters:

- **Default Feedback Period**: 1 month
- **Frozen Period**: 1 week
- **Governance Cycle**: Monthly
- **Other Requirements**: None.

### MIP113c5: Scope Framework Articles modification Sub Proposal process

During the Pregame the Scope Framework articles can be modified through the Monthly Governance Cycle using a MIP102c2 subproposal.
