## MIP113c1: Preamble

The Arbitration Scope covers principles and processes related to high-level decision-making, constitutional interpretation, and regulation of constitutional conservers and core governance processes. The Arbitration Scope plays a critical role in governance security, and its processes and rules must be defined to ensure they are followed with care and precision. The Arbitration Scope constrains and supersedes all other Scope Frameworks.

## MIP113c2: Scope Framework Articles

### 1: Constitutional Interpretation

#### 1.1: Constitutional Interpretation definition
Constitutional Interpretation is used to disambiguate elements in the constitution with expanded definitions, in connection with specific decisions or disputes relying on language from the Maker Constitution. To make the Maker Constitution as solid and immutable as possible, all constitutional interpretation is recorded to set a precedent about the spirit of the constitution and how future interpretations should be made.

#### 1.2: Constitutional Interpretation Principles
##### 1.2.1: Constitutional Interpretation should only be employed when the Maker Constitution itself is unclear or contains faults or omissions that can be mitigated by extrapolating the spirit of the Constitution.  
---
##### 1.2.2: The resolution of constitutional ambiguity or disputes must be fully congruent with the spirit of the Constitution and prior precedent.  
---
##### 1.2.3: The resolution of constitutional ambiguity or disputes must clearly set new precedent that prevents a similar ambiguous situation from occurring in the future.  
---
##### 1.2.4: If the existence or proposed resolution of an ambiguity becomes contentious, one or more MKR votes may be initiated by the Arbitration Facilitators to resolve the contention.  

#### 1.3 Constitutional Intepretation Process
##### 1.3.1: Constitutional Interpretation precedent may be made directly by the Arbitration Facilitators without any MKR vote.
###### 1.3.1.1 Constitutional Interpretation precedent made directly by the Arbitration Facilitators must be recorded as a subelement to the Active Element *1.3.3A*.
###### 1.3.1.2 Entries to Active Element *1.3.3A* through *1.3.1* must denote the source of the precedent as 'Arbitration Direct'.
---
##### 1.3.2: Constitutional Interpretation precedent may be made according to the outcome of an MKR vote initiated by the Arbitration Facilitators.
###### 1.3.2.1 Any MKR vote on constitutional precedent must contain a proposed change to the wording of the constitution, which is limited to resolving the ambiguity.
###### 1.3.2.2 Any MKR vote on constitutional precedent must contain a proposed entry to Active Element 1.3.3A, detailing the precedent used to resolve the ambiguity.
###### 1.3.2.3 If the outcome of the vote meets the requirements of Article 11 of the Constitution then the Constitution is amended using the proposed change described in *1.3.2.1*.
###### 1.3.2.4 If the outcome of the vote is positive, the Constitutional Interpretation precedent must be recorded as a subelement in the Active Element *1.3.3A* using the proposed change described in *1.3.2.2*.
###### 1.3.2.5 Entries to Active Element *1.3.3A* through *1.3.2* must denote the source of the precedent as 'Arbitration Vote'.
###### 1.3.2.6 With the exception of the other elements under *1.3.2*, any MKR vote intended to resolve ambiguity in the Constitution may be structured freely by the Arbitration Facilitators.

### 2: Scope Framework Appeals

#### 2.1: Scope Framework Appeals Eligibility
A Scope Framework appeal is a process that triggers a review of a Scope Framework. This process is valid in either of the following scenarios:
##### 2.1.1: A Scope Framework appeal is valid if a Scope Framework does not adhere to every Constitutional Boundary.
---
##### 2.1.2: A Scope Framework appeal is valid if a Scope Framework contains biased or otherwise conflicted elements.

#### 2.2: Scope Framework Appeals Process
The Scope Framework appeal process must adhere to the following rules:
##### 2.2.1: Scope Framework appeal proposals may only be submitted by CVC members.  
---
##### 2.2.2: Scope Framework appeal proposals must be submitted publicly.  
---
##### 2.2.3: Scope Framework appeal proposals must be reviewed by the Arbitration Facilitators.  
---
##### 2.2.4: Scope Framework appeal proposals must be declared valid or invalid by the Arbitration Facilitators. Declaration and reasoning must be publicly communicated.  
---
##### 2.2.5: Scope Framework appeal proposals must be declared accepted or rejected by the Arbitration Facilitators. Declaration and reasoning must be publicly communicated.  
---
#### 2.3 Modifications to Scope Frameworks on Constitutional Grounds
Modifications to Scope Frameworks on Constitutional Grounds must adhere to the following rules:
##### 2.3.1: The Arbitration Facilitators may directly edit a Scope Framework to align its content with the constitutional boundaries and any other constitutional requirements. Changes and reasoning must be publicly communicated.  
---
##### 2.3.2: The Arbitration Facilitators may initiate an MKR vote to ratify an edit to a Scope Framework that resolves the issue(s) that triggered a valid, accepted Scope Framework appeal.

---

### 3: Constitutional Conserver Management

#### 3.1: Constitutional Conserver Management Definition
Constitutional Conservers are Ecosystem Actors that adhere to a set of constitutional requirements. Membership of the Constitutional Conservers is managed by the Arbitration Facilitators according to strict rules.

#### 3.2: Constitutional Conserver Requirements
Constitutional Conservers must support the integrity of the Constitution, as described in the elements of this section.
##### 3.2.1: Constitutional Conservers may not support or incite action that breaks the Constitutional Boundaries of the Constitution.

#### 3.3: Constitutional Conserver Recognition
##### 3.3.1: The Arbitration Facilitators are responsible for recognizing Constitutional Conservers. The process of obtaining recognition is specific to each type of Constitutional Conserver.  
---
##### 3.3.2: The Arbitration Facilitators must derecognize Constitutional Conservers that they determine have meaningfully broken the Constitutional Conserver adherence requirements specified in *3.2*.  
---
##### 3.3.3: A Constitutional Conserver may only be Recognized in one Constitutional Conserver role at any one time.  
---
##### 3.3.4: Derecognition of an Ecosystem Actor identity can be done by an Arbitration Facilitator, by directly adding them to the Active Element *3.3.1.1A*.
###### 3.3.1.1A:

#### 3.4: Consitutional Conserver Fallbacks
If a Constitutional Conserver breaks the adherence requirements, but the Arbitration Facilitators fail to derecognize them, the following fallback process may be used.
##### 3.4.1: Any entity may send 10 MKR to the Pause Proxy contract, and publicly communicate their intention to derecognize an identified Constitutional Conserver.  
---
##### 3.4.2: The Arbitration Facilitators must initiate an MKR vote to derecognize the identified Constitutional Conserver if the requirements of *3.4.1* are met.
###### 3.4.2.1 The vote format is plurality and must include the following three options: 'Yes', 'No, and burn stake' and 'No, and return stake').
###### 3.4.2.2 If the 'Yes' option wins by majority, the Constitutional Conserver is derecognized, and the 10 MKR is returned to the source address.
###### 3.4.2.3 If the 'No, and return stake' option wins by plurality, the 10 MKR is returned to the source address.
###### 3.4.2.4 Otherwise, the 10 MKR is not returned to the source address.

---

### 4: Constitutional Voter Committee Management

#### 4.1: Constitutional Voter Committee Definition
Constitutional Voter Committees are organized groups of Ecosystem Actors with publicly verified MKR ownership. Their role is to represent the interests of MKR holders and form opinions on the direction of Maker Governance, primarily through the modification of Scope Frameworks in quarterly cycles.

#### 4.2: Constitutional Voter Committee Member Recognition

##### 4.2.1: To become recognized as an Unaffiliated CVC Member, an Ecosystem Actor must post a recognition submission message publicly on the Maker Governance Forum.
###### 4.2.1.1 A recognition submission message must be cryptographically signed by an Ethereum address that controls at least 1 MKR. The MKR can be any combination of MKR held in the wallet, deposited into the Chief, or delegated to a Protocol Delegation Smart Contract.
###### 4.2.1.2 The cryptograpically signed CVC Member Recognition Message must contain the information specified in *4.2.1.2.1* and *4.2.1.2.2*. The information specified in *4.2.1.2.3* and *4.2.1.2.4* is optional.

  * **4.2.1.2.1:** The following text must be included: "CVC Member Recognition".
  * **4.2.1.2.2:** A timestamp recording the time and date that the message was signed.
  * **4.2.1.2.3:** The desired name of the CVC Member.
  * **4.2.1.2.4:** The CVC that the CVC Member wishes to join, if applicable.

###### 4.2.1.3: The amount of MKR controlled by the CVC member's address as defined in *4.2.1.1* will become the CVC Member's *Verified MKR Holding*.

  * **4.2.1.3.1:** A CVC Member may opt to use an MKR amount as their *Verified MKR Holding* that is less than the amount of MKR controlled by their address as defined in *4.2.1.1*. This should be clearly indicated when they post their recognition submission message.	
  * **4.2.1.3.2:** A CVC Member's *Verified MKR Holding* will be used as their vote-weight in internal CVC Decision votes, even if their address accumulates more MKR.	
  * **4.2.1.3.3:** If the the amount of MKR controlled by the CVC member's address as defined in *4.2.1.1* drops below their *Verified MKR Holding*, they are automatically offboarded from the CVC, until a vote to onboard them again takes place.	
  * **4.2.1.3.4:** A CVC Member that is already a member of a CVC can apply to update their *Verified MKR Holding* through the CVC Decision process, see *4.5.4.8*.	
  * **4.2.1.3.5:** Unaffiliated CVC Members may update their *Verified MKR Holding* at any time by submitting a signed message underneath their initial CVC Member Recognition Message. When an Unaffiliated CVC Member applies to join a CVC, their *Verified MKR Holding* is frozen until their application is rejected, or a future CVC Decision is taken to update their *Verified MKR Holding*.	

###### 4.2.1.4: A recognition submission message must use the format described in *4.2.1.5*.	
###### 4.2.1.5:

```
Title: CVC Member Recognition submission
CVC member recognition submission
[Ethereum address]
[Cryptographically signed CVC Member Recognition Message]
```

###### 5.2.1.3 The submission message must be cryptographically signed by the deploying Ethereum address.
* **5.2.1.3.1:** Since an Ethereum address may only control a single Protocol Delegation System smart contract, Constitutional Delegates should cryptographically demonstrate that they control the Ethereum address that controls each of their deployed Protocol Delegation System smart contracts.
###### 5.2.1.4 The cryptograpically signed CD Recognition Submission Messages must contain the information specified in *5.2.1.4.1* and *5.2.1.4.2*.
* **5.2.1.4.1:** The following text must be included: "Constitutional Delegate Recognition".
* **5.2.1.4.2:** A timestamp recording the time and date that the message was signed.
###### 5.2.1.5 The submission message must follow this template:

```
Title: CD Recognition Submission
CD Recognition Submission
[Ecosystem Actor Ethereum address]
[Ethereum address of Delegation Contract 1]:[Followed CVC 1]
[Ethereum address of Delegation Contract 2]:[Followed CVC 2]
[Cryptograpically signed CD Recognition Submission Message from the Ethereum address controlling Delegation Contract 1]
[Cryptograpically signed CD Recognition Submission Message from the Ethereum address controlling Delegation Contract 2]
[Cryptograpically signed CD Recognition Submission Message from the Ecosystem Actor Ethereum address, where this address is not one of the addresses controlling a Delegation Contract]

##### 5.2.2: A Constitutional Delegate must maintain a minimum level of activity or lose their recognition as a Constitutional Delegate
###### 5.2.2.1 A CD must maintain a minimum voting activity of 75% participation in all votes on average.
###### 5.2.2.2 A CD must maintain a minimum communication activity, having provided comments for 75% of all votes on average.
---
##### 5.2.3: A Constitutional Delegate must adhere to the requirements below or lose their recognition as both a Constitutional Delegate and a Constitutional Conserver.
###### 5.2.3.1 CDs must help make CVC Member participation as easy as possible by focusing on providing access to facts and data, and advise CVC Members on decisions aligned with the spirit of the CVC.
###### 5.2.3.2 CDs may not incite political factionalism or initiate political or strategic movements.
###### 5.2.3.3 CDs may not represent Maker externally, or be perceived to do so through their actions, or engage directly with counterparties or ecosystem participants other than the CVCs, on business related to Maker Governance, or business that could be in conflict of interest with their role as CDs. The exception to this requirement is data and knowledge gathering and knowledge capacity development with the aid of internal ecosystem participants, or external entities, performed with the sole goal of sharing the data, knowledge and conclusions publicly with the CVCs to help them perform better in their role and stay within the boundaries of the spirit of the constitution.
###### 5.2.3.4 CDs must not take actions that could be perceived to put the security of Maker Governance in jeopardy through the politicization of the CD role.
###### 5.2.3.5 CDs may not collaborate to influence Maker Governance in groups or structures outside of the CVCs.
###### 5.2.3.6 CDs may not influence or argue for the removal of checks or restrictions on CDs, or increase in their decision making powers or broadening of their responsibilities.

#### 5.3: Constitutional Delegate Actions

##### 5.3.1: CDs have formal actions that they take through cryptographically signed messages to the Maker Governance Forum.
###### 5.3.1.1 CDs may switch to a new Governance Strategy by posting a message that specifies a new delegate contract and a new CVC strategy to follow. 
---
##### 5.3.2: The Arbitration Facilitators must ensure the results of any Constitutional Delegate action are represented on the Easy Governance Frontend.

#### 5.4: Constitutional Delegate Income Management

The top 14 CDs with the highest combined MKR delegated to their delegate contracts, who also meet minimum requirements, are eligible to receive CD income. There are two levels of CD income: Prime Constitutional Delegates (PCDs) and Reserve Constitutional Delegates (RCDs). For the purposes of calculating Constitutional Delegate income, only MKR delegated to contracts listed in 5.2.4.2A is counted.

##### 5.4.1: Prime Constitutional Delegates (PCDs)
###### 5.4.1.1 The top 7 qualifying CDs, based on the aggregate amount of MKR delegated to their delegate contracts, are the PCDs.
###### 5.4.1.2 PCDs must participate in at least 85% of the CVC Subcommittee Meetings hosted by CVCs whose strategies they follow each quarter.
###### 5.4.1.3 The 7 PCD slots share a total of 2,000 MKR per year, equivalent to 285.7 MKR per year for each PCD, or 23.8 MKR per month for each PCD.
---
##### 5.4.2: Reserve Constitutional Delegates (RCDs)
###### 5.4.2.1 The top 7 qualifying CDs that are not PCDs, based on the aggregate amount of MKR delegated to their delegate contracts, are the RCDs.
###### 5.4.2.2 RCDs must participate in at least 50% of the CVC Subcommittee Meetings hosted by CVCs whose strategies they follow each quarter.
###### 5.4.2.3 The 7 RCD slots share a total of 500 MKR per year, equivalent to 71.4 MKR per year for each RCD, or 5.95 MKR per month for each RCD.
---
##### 5.4.3: CD income payouts are adjusted based on voting activity metrics for votes occurring since they were recognized and within the last 12 months.
###### 5.4.3.1 If a CD has voted in less than 95% of votes, they receive a reduced CD income.
###### 5.4.3.2 The income reduction is proportionally linear until it reaches 0 CD income at 75% voting activity.
###### 5.4.3.3 If a CD's voting activity falls below 75%, they receive no CD income.
---
##### 5.4.4: CD income payouts are adjusted based on communication metrics for votes occurring since they were recognized and within the last 12 months.
###### 5.4.4.1 If a CD meets the communication requirement for less than 95% of votes, they receive a reduced CD income.
###### 5.4.4.2 The income reduction is proportionally linear until it reaches 0 CD income at 75% communication activity.
###### 5.4.4.3 The reduction in income is proportionally linear, reaching 0 CD income at 75% communication activity.
###### 5.4.4.4 If a CD's communication activity falls below 75%, they receive no CD income.
---
##### 5.4.5: CD income payouts are made monthly by the Arbitration Facilitators, who bundle MKR payments into an Executive Vote.
###### 5.4.5.1 CD income payouts will be made to the Ecosystem Actor Ethereum Address specified by the CD when they submit their CD Recognition Submission message and recorded in *5.2.4.2A*.

### 6: Core Units and Facilitators

#### 6.1: Core Units and Facilitator Management
During the pregame, the Arbitration Scope manages and provides the budget for Core Units and Facilitators, while designating their responsible Scopes. The role of Arbitration Facilitators is further defined in MIP113c3.
##### 6.1.1: The Ecosystem Actor name, Ethereum address and budgets are contained in *6.1.1.1A*. The Active Element is changed through the ordinary CVC process.

##### 6.1.3: If all Facilitators of a Scope are unresponsive and not taking care of their duties, a majority of the remaining Facilitators can choose amongst themselves an interim Facilitator, that will then temporarily become the Responsible Facilitator for the Scope
---
##### 6.1.4: Reserve Facilitators can help protect the continuity of Maker Governance in case other Facilitators become unavailable. If the main Facilitators of a scope become unresponsive or otherwise unavailable, the Reserve Facilitators can initiate a take over as interim Facilitators by posting their observations of inactivity or unavailability to the Maker Core forum. If the take over is not disputed by the existing Facilitators within 48 hours, the Reserve Facilitators are changed to Facilitators in *6.1.2.1A*, and must take care of the duties of the role until a new Facilitator is selected using the ordinary CVC process.
###### 6.1.4.1 The Arbitration Facilitators can propose expedited onboarding of Reserve Facilitators in order to ensure enough Facilitators are available to gaurantee governance continuity. This is done by posting the name(s), ethereum address(es) and scope(s) of responsibility of the proposed Reserve Facilitators to the Maker Core forum. This triggers a Governance Poll following the Weekly Governance Cycle. If the Governance Poll is approved, the Reserve Facilitators are added to *6.1.2.1A*.
