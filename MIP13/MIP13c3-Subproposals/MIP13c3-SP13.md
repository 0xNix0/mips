## Specification

### Context and Motivation

Current RWA monitoring is lagging behind [as much as 13 months in the case of New Silver](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12VwbP0UxdL7Ck38SnwC-Ok8Pjo1O2F1Ryrf9gv7Mp88/edit#gid=1553817594). MakerDAO is scaling up RWA vaults for yield and diversification. We need to develop maximum transparency around that.

Currently no core Unit is explicitly and directly responsible for monitoring RWA vaults for violations of covenants or reporting obligations. Strategic Finance (SF-001) has developed some solutions, in extension of their mandate, and at considerable extra cost and effort. Flipside Governance wants to applaud these initiatives. RWA counterparties have professed additional reporting.
